  <p>This is not a standard simplifience sequence. It is a sample designed to show how difficult concepts can be intuitive with a good explanation.</p>

  <p>The articles here break many <a href="/intro/contrives.html" target="_blank">simplifience policies</a>. All of the concepts covered here will show up in greater detail in later articles.</p>
</div>

<p>Math is obfuscated by its archaic notation and its clumsy presentation. Take, for example, the strange equation known as &#8220;Euler&#8217;s Identity&#8221;:</p>

<p class="number">$e^{\pi i} = \text{&#8211;}1$</p>

<p>You may have stumbled across this identity before. If you haven&#8217;t, take a moment to really look at it and realize how extraordinary this is.</p>

<p>This formula claims that $e$ (the base of the natural logarithm, an irrational number) raised to the power $\pi$ (relating circle circumference to diameter, also irrational) times <em>an imaginary number</em> is not only <em>meaningful</em>, but it&#8217;s a real whole number: negative one.</p>

<p>This is a mind-bending assertion. An irrational raised to the power of an <em>imaginary irrational</em> is somehow equal to negative one? This identity surprised and confounded many when it was first discovered.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Gentlemen, that is surely true, it is absolutely paradoxical; we cannot understand it, and we don&#8217;t know what it means. But we have proved it, and therefore we know it must be the truth.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#8217;s Benjamin Peirce, an American mathematician and Harvard professor failing to understand Euler&#8217;s identity.</p>

<p>This is exactly how math shouldn&#8217;t be.</p>

<p>Euler&#8217;s identity, it turns out, is easy to understand intuitively once you understand the three building blocks.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="/sample/growth.html" target="_blank">$e$ is growth</a>.</li>
  <li><a href="/sample/semicircle.html" target="_blank">$\pi$ is half the circumference of a circle</a>.</li>
  <li><a href="/sample/imagine.html" target="_blank">$i$ is the number one rotated a quarter turn</a>.</li>
</ul>

<aside class="info">
  <p>Follow the links to build up intuitive understandings of $e$, $\pi$, and $i$. Understanding of Euler&#8217;s identity will follow.</p>
</aside>

<p>Once you understand $e$, $\pi$, and $i$ there is only one more <a href="/intro/contrives.html" target="_blank">contrive</a> standing in the way of understanding the identity.</p>

<p>You&#8217;ve been taught that $x^5$ means $x*x*x*x*x$: five $x$s multiplied together. But what&#8217;s $x^i$? $x$ times itself an imaginary number of times?</p>

<p>Remember that $i$ is no more nor less imaginary than $1$. In fact, $i$ is just $1$ rotated $\frac{1}{4}$ turns. So then $x^i$ is $x$ times itself one time but that one time is rotated? That doesn&#8217;t make sense.</p>

<p>The contrive here is <em>exponentiation</em> &#8211; when you have a number plane instead of a number line, exponentiation isn&#8217;t just repeated multiplication. How do you repeat something a turned number of times? What does that even mean?</p>

<p>The true nature of exponentiation will be revealed in other simplifience sequences. For now, we&#8217;re going to dodge the problem.</p>

<p>$p * e^x$ is just notation for $(grow\ p\ x)$: grow principle $p$ at rate $x$ compounding continuously. You&#8217;ll remember that the formula to calculate the end result is <span class="info">$\displaystyle p * e^x = \lim_{n \to \infty} p * (1 + \tfrac{x}{n})^n$</span>.</p>

<aside class="info">
  <p>$(1 + \frac{x}{n})$ is amount you grow each time you compound: $100\%$ plus an $n^{th}$ fraction of the interest rate ($x$).</p>

  <p>You scale the principle ($p$) by this amount $n$ times.</p>

  <p>Continuous growth is growth compounded an infinite number of times ($n \to \infty$).</p>
</aside>

<p>Using this formula we have a way to figure out what imaginary exponents mean. At least, we can figure out one particular imaginary exponent: $\displaystyle p * e^i = (grow\ p\ i) = \lim_{n \to \infty} p * (1 + \tfrac{i}{n})^n$</p>

<p>The interesting part is this: $p * e^i = (grow\ p\ i)$. This is the core of Euler&#8217;s identity. $(grow\ p\ 1)$ has an obvious meaning: take $p$ and grow it by $100\%$ every time period. But what in the blazes does $(grow\ p\ i)$ mean?</p>

<p>$i$ is just $1$ rotated a quarter turn. So what $(grow\ p\ i)$ means is this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Take the principle and grow it by $100\%$ per time period, making the interest perpendicular to the principle.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Remember that the use of $i$ puts us on a number plane, not a number line. It&#8217;s not enough to say that we add $100\%$ interest: we also have to specify which direction the interest is added in. Growing $i$ is the same as growing $100\%$ except that the interest is paid out a quarter turn away from the principle.</p>

<p>To see how this works, let&#8217;s consider growing 1 by $i$, compounding <span class="info">only once</span>. This is just $1 * (1 + i)^1$ = $1 + i$. You start at one, and then all of the interest is vertical.</p>

<div class="complex-plane"></div>

<p>We&#8217;ve stepped off of the number line and onto the number plane: when you grow a number by $i$, you&#8217;re going perpindicular.</p>

<p>What if we compound twice? We start with $1$. Then our first interest payment is $\frac{i}{2}$, so we&#8217;re at $1 + \frac{i}{2}$.</p>

<p>The second interest payment isn&#8217;t $\frac{i}{2}$ &#8211; the second interest payment is $50\%$, but remember that all interest payments are <em>perpendicular to the value</em>, and the value is now $1 + \frac{i}{2}$. We pay out $50\%$ of the magnitude of the new value, paid with a $\frac{1}{4}$ turn. Check it out:</p>

<div class="compound" data-n="2"></div>

<aside class="info">
  <p>Interest payments are the dashed lines. They are $50\%$ of the current value in magnitude and $\frac{1}{4}$ of a turn rotated.</p>
</aside>

<p>Take a moment to look at a circle. Notice how at any point along the edge of a circle the circle is <em>locally straight</em>. If you zoom in where the circle intercepts the horizontal axis, the circle looks vertical. In other words, the line tangent to a circle is <span class="info">perpendicular to the radius</span>.</p>

<aside class="info">
  <p>This property is sufficient to define circles.</p>
</aside>

<div class="tangents"></div>

<aside class="info">
  <p>Circles are like a bunch of infinitely short right triangles all stacked atop each other.</p>
</aside>

<p>Keep that in mind while we compound three times, paying a third of the value each time and paying out at right angles.</p>

<div class="compound" data-n="3"></div>

<aside class="info">
  <p>Make three right triangles where the height is $\frac{1}{3}$ of the previous hypotenuse and stack them atop each other.</p>
</aside>

<p>Do you see what&#8217;s going on here? The more we compound the interest payments, the less it goes into <em>increasing</em> the principle and the more it goes into <em>turning</em> the principle.</p>

<p>When the perpendicular growth is compounded continuously (as $n \to \infty$), <em>all</em> of the growth goes towards pushing the principle onto a new axis, and <em>none</em> of it goes towards growth. Check it out:</p>

<div class="compound" data-n="[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, 20, 30]" data-circle="true"></div>

<aside class="info">
  <p>$(1 + \frac{i}{n})^n$ for $n$ from $1$ to $30$.</p>

  <p>The more we compound the more the growth goes towards rotating the principle instead of extending it.</p>
</aside>

<p>We&#8217;re creating shorter and shorter right triangles and stacking them on top of each other. Sound familiar?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Continuous growth which is always perpendicular to the principle is just another way to say &#8220;circular motion&#8221;.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Woah. That&#8217;s pretty cool. $e^i = (grow\ 1\ i)$ describes circular motion. How much circular motion? One radius distance. The original principle ($1$) is acting as the radius of the circular motion. The growth rate is $i$ which is just another name for $1$ at a quarter turn. In circular growth the interest never accumulates, it only rotates. $(grow\ 1\ i)$ is one radius-distance of circular movement, also known as &#8220;rotation by one radian&#8221;.</p>

<p>$e^{2i} = (grow\ 1\ 2i)$ is twice as much circular motion: rotation by two radians. And $e^{\pi i} = (grow\ 1\ \pi i)$?</p>

<div class="compound" data-n="[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, 25, 50, 100]" data-circle="true" data-factor="pi"></div>

<aside class="info">
  <p>$e^{\pi i} = (grow\ 1\ \pi i) = (rotate\ 1\ \pi)$</p>

  <p>Calculated by $\displaystyle \lim_{n \to \infty} (1 + \tfrac{\pi\ i}{n})^n$.</p>
</aside>

<p>It&#8217;s $\pi$ radian distances of rotation, which is a walk halfway around the circle.</p>

<p class="number">$e^{\pi i} = \text{&#8211;}1$</p>
