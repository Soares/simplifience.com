Simplifience won't be using math equations.

This is in part due to the fact that @post[math is not a thing]foundations/mathematics.

Mostly it's because @post[math is archaic]math/archaic. The syntax of mathematics is old and poorly thought out. It is confusing and intimidating to newcomers. It doesn't display nicely on computer screens.

I don't mean to discourage you from using math equations: if you are already comfortable with the syntax, then by all means, continue using it. It is quite terse and compact.

Terseness and compactness are not the allies of education.

Compare the following:

$\displaystyle \lim\_{n\to\infty} p * (1 + \frac{r}{n})^n$

$(principle\textbf{ scaled by }(1\textbf{ plus }(rate\textbf{ divided by }n))\textbf{ }n\textbf{ times})\textbf{ as }n\textbf{ approaches }\infty$

These equations say the same things. The first is far denser and is intuitive only if you have already internalized the quirks and customs of mathematics. The other is simple to understand for anyone who speaks English.

Both equations have the same level of rigor. Language is @post[a powerful tool]language/scope, and it is @post[difficult to say simple things]language/simplicity -- English is not a good medium for discussing how the universe works. In order to describe the universe, we must use a notation that leaves no room for misinterpretation: *but that language need not be mathematics*.

Simplifience will use a language @post[more suited to newcomers]intro/notation.



@post[Words are powerful]language/scope.

@post[Many words are needed to say simple things]language/simplicity.

@post[Reality has rules]reality/rules, and learning those rules gives us power.

When you put all these things together, you'll find that the rules of reality are difficult to describe in English. English just says too much. It can be interpreted too many ways.

This is why humans developed the formal notation known as mathematics: strange symbols which say a lot once you understand what they mean. It looks something like this:

> $\displaystyle \sum\limits\_{n=1}^N x\_n^2$

While well-intentioned, this is not far from gibberish. It is compact, surely, but it is far from an ideal representation of what is going on. For instance, the above equation can be better described thus:

> Sum the squares of all $x$s (there are $N$ of them).

Among professionals, the former style is preferred for its compactness. The former style, though cryptic, has one other advantage as well: it's unambiguous. Many sentences have multiple meanings. Remember that it is @post[hard to say simple things]language/simplicity.

Simplifience will prefer the second method, the spoken explanations. However, simplifience will also provide equations. They will not look quite so forbidding as the one above, and they will follow simpler rules, but we must provide unambiguous equations for the rules of nature.

Simplifience equations will look more like this:

> $(\textbf{Sum }(\textbf{area of a square with side }x)\textbf{ for each }x\textbf{ in }xs)$

This is more verbose, surely, but also unambiguous.

This is necessary because my sentences can be misinterpreted. There are corners that my words will fail to cover. Every analogy that I make will break down at the edges.

The equations describe how the universe really works. I hope that my words will as well, but words are much harder to tie down. The equations are provided so that when you find any ambiguities, you can sate your curiosity by examining the equations.

That said, the equations need not look scary. They need not be intimidating. The rules of the universe are actually pretty simple. If you're comfortable with a more compact syntax like the math equation above, that is great: but when you're learning something, be careful not to sacrifice clarity for compactness.






Some parts of reality don't change, though. $2 + 3 = 5$, and we expect that to remain true indefinitely. It's hard to imagine a world where you have $\|\|$ things in your left hand and $\|\|\|$ things in your right hand, and all together there are not $\|\|\|\|\|$ things.

We have words for such properties of the universe. Words like "addition". These words, like any other, are malleable. You can say "add me to the list" without implying that you and the list are numbers to be summed.

The deep underlying rules of the universe can be described in English, but it is difficult. It is not difficult to completely define addition because addition is a difficult concept. Quite the opposite. It is difficult to use English words to define addition because addition is *simple*. Words are powerful. They say many things. The difficulty in describing addition stems from narrowing down the meaning. You must use many words to make sure you are specifying the single, simple rule that is addition.

It is easy to say "addition is about combining numbers" -- but an alien might hear this and conclude that $1 + 2 = 12$. We must use many words to narrow down a very specific thing that happens in reality: the property that $\|\|$ things plus $\|\|\|$ things is $\|\|\|\|\|$ things, assuming that the things @post[act like numbers]foundations/number.






It's also bad at expressing rules.

Imagine teaching addition to an alien who knows English but not mathematics. You could say "addition is for combining numbers". They'll nod and conclude that 1 + 2 = 12.

<!--TODO: Add a link to the operator sequence ADDITION definition here.-->
The problem isn't that you can't describe addition in English. You surely can. It turns out it's a bit difficult to unambiguously define addition from scratch, but you can do it in English. Once you do, you can give that operation a name (addition). You can make up a symbol which carries the meaning ($+$).

Once this word and this symbol end up in the language, they become part of modern parlance. They become malleable, just like the rest of language. You can say things like "add me to the list" without meaning $me + list =\ ???$.

And that's fine too. Malleable language is good. However, there is some part of addition, some part of $+$, that is not malleable. There is some part of reality that *acts like addition*. Whenever you have this many things on your left:

> $\|\|$

and this many things on your right:

> $\|\|\|$

you have this many things in total:

> $\|\|\|\|\|$

This is a <span class="info" markdown="inline">*truth*</span>. It's a way that reality always acts. It is a fairly self-evident truth, but it is a truth all the same. And this truth, @post[no matter what you call it]reality/symbology, is not malleable. Any symbol which we attach to this truth, any word about this truth that enters our language, can be twisted: but the underlying truth cannot.

<aside class="info" markdown="block">
We happen to write this truth $2 + 3 = 5$, but it's true no matter what symbols you use to write it down.
</aside>

This truth seems self evident and perhaps not worth articulating. However, it's much less self-evident that $\|\|\|\|\|\|\|\|\|\|\|\|\| + \|\|\|\|\|\|\|\|\|\|\|\|\|\|\|\|\|\|\| = \|\|\|\|\|\|\|\|\|\|\|\|\|\|\|\|\|\|\|\|\|\|\|\|\|\|\|\|\|\|\|\|\|$. If you ever have a warehouse with more than $\|\|\|\|\|\|\|\|\|\|\|\|\|\|\|\|\|\|\|\|\|\|\|\|\|\|\|\|\|\|\|\|\|\|\|\|\|\|\|\|\|\|\|\|\|\|\|\|\|\|\|\|\|\|\|\|\|\|\|\|\|$ things then you'd best start figuring out the rules.

There are two very interesting takeaways here. One is that @post[there are ways reality always acts]reality/rules. There are things that are true, and we can figure them out. The second takeaway is that figuring out the rules in simple cases lets us figure things out that are *way* @post[beyond our level]math/explore. If you try to add 16347 tick marks to 2857 tick marks, you'll almost certainly make a mistake. But, *because I know the rules that reality follows*, I can tell you right now that if you do it right you'll get $16347 + 2857 = 19204$ tick marks.

Also, unlocking the secrets of the universe is the only way to sate your burning drive to discover the true nature of existence.

When we discover or discuss rules of reality, we can't really use language. At least, we can't use the social languages. Social languages are varied and dynamic, for good reason. The rules of the universe are <span class="info" markdown="inline">completely unchanging</span>. We still use words and symbols, just like a social language, but we draw clear boundaries between the spoken language and the formal notation which describes truths.

<aside class="info" markdown="block">
If something that we thought was a rule ends up changing, then it turns out that it wasn't really a rule and we have to go back and figure out how and why it changed.
</aside>

The word "addition" in English is malleable. It can evolve over time. You can say "add me to the list" without wanting to be literally combined with a single list. But the *actual plus*, the rule that $\|\| + \|\|\| = \|\|\|\|\|$, is unchanging. "Add one to two" has holes in it. It can conceivably mean $1 + 2 = 12$. I'm allowed to form that sentence.

But if we say it in formal notation, once we've defined all our axioms, then $1 + 2 = 3$. In the context of formal notation, $1 + 2 = 12$ is *wrong* -- once you've accepted the meaning of the symbols and acknowledged the axioms of arithmetic.

We *can* describe the rules of the universe in English, but such descriptions usually leave holes for misinterpretation. The formal notation can only be interpreted one way, and that is its strength.

The formal notation that we'll be using isn't the mainstream mathematics taught in schools, though it is something of a descendant. We'll be describing the equations in English as much as possible.

The important thing to remember is that words are full of ambiguities and hand-waving. The formal notation is correct, regardless of what the sentences imply.





As science grew up, it got better at avoiding these pitfalls. Humans got better at going out to reality and checking their claims. Humans got better at demanding theories which *actually said things* instead of just shuffling labels around. The impact on science was *enormous* -- we had an industrial revolution, landed people on the moon, and invented the internet. Science got far better at avoiding the obvious mistakes.

<aside class="info" markdown="block">
We got *better* at avoiding these mistakes, but we certainly haven't eliminated them. Humans are easy to mislead and slow to learn the lessons of history.
</aside>

Though science got better at avoiding the obvious errors, humanity recently stumbled upon a completely new class of scientific error: we discovered that sometimes the models we make are only *mostly* right. The old absolute physics was completely overturned by the discoveries of relativity. The absolute models of motion were superseded by relativistic models.

This was a special new kind of wrong. The absolute models were still correct in most cases. They helped build airplanes and skyscrapers. They were worth believing: they made real predictions, and reality bore those predictions out, and the predictions allowed humanity to do incredible things.

*And they were still wrong.*

Absolute physics worked in most applications that common engineers could think up, but the absolute model of motion assumed axioms that reality does not follow. Absolute physics is right in some cases. In fact, it's right in most common cases that a human will think up. But it's not right in *all* cases -- as soon as you ask the right questions, absolute physics shatters like glass.

We don't teach students about the five elements. Oh, sure, we might *mention* the five elements. We say things like "the silly Greeks thought the world was made of only air, fire, earth, and water". We <span class="info" markdown="inline">scoff</span> at such a delusion. We never teach it as truth.

<aside class="info" markdown="block">
It is easy to forget the difficulty of @post[having obvious ideas]reality/obvious.
</aside>

We don't teach élan vital or phlogiston, either. They don't belong in science classes. History of science, perhaps, but not science.

Why, then, do we still teach absolute physics?

Absolute models of motion are wrong. They're a good approximation for most motion in small spaces, but they're wrong. Why, then, do physics classes *start* by teaching outdated Newtonian mechanics?

There are two major justifications for this madness which don't hold up under pressure.


* Newtonian mechanics is simpler. Students just aren't ready to learn relativistic mechanics when they're in high school.

---

Who in their right mind would try to teach Newtonian mechanics before relativistic mechanics? I can think of two possible justifications for this madness:

* Newtonian mechanics is more useful. Relativity and quantum mechanics might be the truth, but neither will tell you how to build an airplane. If you live on earth, you need to know earth-centric simplifications.

This argument sure made a lot of sense, *two hundred years ago*. We used to need engineers who could crunch the numbers and build bridges that didn't fall down. We used to need aeronautical engineers who could turn the cranks and make airplanes a little better. Now we have computers.

@post[We don't need crank-turners any more]math/education. Newtonian mechanics is a good approximation of motion in the common ranges that humans usually see them. But humans don't *need* to know those equations any more. The pool champions of the world aren't really really good at solving differential equations in their heads. You don't need to know the laws of gravity before you can play catch. Your brain already approximates the rules that you need to know in your everyday life, and computers already calculate them with precision for engineers.

While you're here, it's important not to mix up your mental model of reality with actual reality. You live in a brain, so it's easy to confuse those two things. But remember, there is a difference between the way you think reality is and @post[the way reality actually is]reality/truth. But the map is not the territory. Your map can be confused, @post[but reality cannot]reality/mystery.

This sequence lays down some basic guidelines that will prepare you to handle the rest of simplifience more easily. It is by no means an extensive introduction to this strange and beautiful place. There are many pitfalls in the realm of understanding, and simplifience cannot adequately prepare you for all of them. Nothing can. But the concepts that are only brushed upon here are explored in depth elsewhere.

The art of learning to believe what is true (and, more importantly, learning to *want* to believe what is true) is called "rationality". It's a crucial part of @post[ratience]ratience/introduction, the @post[successor to science]science/beyond, but it won't be taught here. If you're interested in learning how to seek the truth in general, despite being born into an imperfect mind, you [might want to start here](http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Map_and_Territory_(sequence)).


The alien tries and tries to separate the axe its handle and its blade.

This is all you get to know about the axe.

You see the axe move around, and you notice that the blue dot always stays exactly in the middle of the two red dots. It seems to you that The Axe is always centered between The Handle and The Blade. You begin to suspect that this is a @post[rule of reality]reality/rules.

You begin to wonder why this rule has to be. You look at the radar screen, and it shows you nothing holding the blue dot to the red dots. In fact, you can easily imagine the blue dot leaving the red dots. It would look like this:

If you can imagine it, it should be possible, right? And yet, reality never allows this to happen. No matter how you twist or prod the axe, the blue dot stays firmly anchored to the reds. Reality obeys this rule so firmly and without exception that you begin to suspect it's conspiring against you to keep the blue dot held firmly in its place.

Of course, there is no rule here. Reality is not preventing the blue dot from leaving the red dots. You are not being thwarted. If you could only see the actual axe, you'd realize that the axe *is* the combination of the handle and the blade. Reality isn't holding the blue dot in place -- that's just *where the blue dot goes*. The problem here is in your radar screen: your radar screen shows you three little labels which look like they're completely separate: but in reality, your labels are connected.

Some would say that it's impossible to separate the blue dot from the red dots. They might be able to convince you by making a mathematical proof, but this will feel unsatisfying. People throw around the word "impossible" so frequently that it often means "I don't see how to do it". Sure, it's evident that separating the blue dot from the red dots is *hard*, but is it really impossible? What if in the future we develop new technology --

No, impossible is not the word for this misconception. The blue dot cannot be separated from the red dot because such a proposition is malformed. You can't separate the axe from the handle and the blade because the axe *is* the handle and the blade. Separating the dots is not impossible: rather, the intent to separate the dots is malformed. The question itself is generated by an illusion. Your model has labels that look disconnected when really they are not.

But imagine how difficult it would be to convince you if you could never look at the actual axe. Imagine your frustration, when every time you tried to move the red dots on their own, the blue jumped along behind. Imagine devising clever experiments to separate the dots: One night you move the handle and the blade under cover of darkness. Another night you drop the temperature so low that nothing should be able to move, and then you send in a robot to move the handle and the blade. Another night you swipe the handle and the blade as quickly as you possibly can, making sure that nothing follows. And every time, the axe follows you.

If you could never see the actual axe, it would feel like reality was thwarting your attempts at every turn. It would feel like reality was holding two disparate things together just to spite you.

But really, *the problem is in your labels*. The problem is that you think the axe is separate from the handle and the blade, when really it is not.

Reality is more tightly connected than we think. Our labels, our words, our concepts, which feel disjoint, are actually deeply interwoven. It is possible -- indeed, @post[easy]reality/profound -- to imagine our labels in arrangements that are simply unachievable. *This is not due to reality thwarting you* -- this is due to a misunderstanding of your own labels. This is because your labels are less connected than @post[the things they label]reality/symbology.

It's important to distinguish between impossible things -- things which simply cannot be done -- and these sorts of errors. When we say "you cannot detach the axe from the handle and the blade", we do not mean that it is impossible, we mean that the query is malformed. So instead of calling such statements "impossible", let us instead refer to them as "disjoint".

Can a space ship depart earth faster than the speed of light?

No, it cannot -- *the question is disjoint*. Faster than light travel isn't impossible: rather, your labels for "faster" and "speed of light" are poor labels for how movement actually works. The labels themselves look separate, but the things they describe are connected.
