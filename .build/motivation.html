			<p>Math and Science are wrong.</p>

<p>Oh, they&#8217;re not wrong as in incorrect (though they have drawn incorrect conclusions before). They&#8217;re wrong because they&#8217;re <em>taught</em> wrong.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s not their fault. Math is more than 2,500 years old. It&#8217;s bound to pick up some historical <span class="define">cruft</span> along the way.</p>

<aside class="define">
  <p><strong>cruft</strong> <em>n.</em>
Unnecessary complexities, unwanted excess. Poor design.</p>

<p>See, discoveries in science and mathematics are named long before they&#8217;re understood. It&#8217;s as if scientists and mathematicians found a broad tree trunk one day and named it &#8220;The Trunk&#8221;. Centuries later, they discovered that they had been feeling up an elephant the whole time.</p>

<p><img src="/images/elephant.png" alt="Blind monks" /></p>

<p>Now the elephant is wandering around and we still refer to each individual leg as &#8220;The Trunk&#8221; (even though there&#8217;s more than one of them). To make matters worse, laymen think that &#8220;The Trunk&#8221; refers to the elephant&#8217;s <em>trunk</em> and not an ignorant assessment of each individual <em>leg</em>, and <span class="info">nobody can be convinced</span> that the name is confusing and wrong.</p>

<aside class="info">
That's how it's always been, you see. If it was good enough for Aristotle, why isn't it good enough for you?
</aside>

<p><span class="info">That will not happen here</span>. Simplifience is about understanding the universe in its simplest form.  We&#8217;ll be leaving behind the cruft of history, the crutches of the past, the mistakes of our forebearers.</p>

<aside class="info">
Rather, I will do my best to avoid it. I am only human, of course.
</aside>

<p>In fact, I&#8217;m not even going to <em><span class="rant">mention</span></em> the true mistakes here. If you haven&#8217;t heard them already, I don&#8217;t want to confuse you first before showing you a better way. Because that&#8217;s precisely the problem with science education today.</p>

<aside class="rant">
  <p>I might mention them in the commentary. Red boxes are for mistakes. But even here I won&#8217;t <em>explain</em> them.</p>
</aside>

<p>See, scientists are usually confused for a long time between making new discoveries and figuring out what&#8217;s actually going on. And when we teach science, we drag people through that confusion. We say</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Then, Famous Scientist #1 did experiment A, and look how crazy the result was!
So then Famous Scientist #2 did experiment B, and look! That&#8217;s crazy too!
Nobody understood it!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We do this for <em>decades</em> worth of experimentation before showing students how the experiments were based upon incorrect premises and that there&#8217;s a <span class="simplifience">simple</span> explanation that accounts for all the madness.</p>

<aside class="simplifience">
Simple, but perhaps mind-bending.
</aside>

<p><img src="/images/hugheverettIII.jpg" alt="Look! A scientist!" title="Courtesy Mark Everett" /></p>

<p>We say things like</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>My students aren&#8217;t advanced enough to understand relativity yet,
because they don&#8217;t understand all of the context &#8211;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So we go on teaching <em>wrong, old</em> science to all but the best and brightest.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m <em>not</em> going to drag you through that mud. I&#8217;m going to tell you what
we&#8217;ve discovered, I&#8217;m going to show you how the universe works. I&#8217;m <em>not</em> going
to do it one experiment at a time: I&#8217;m going to tell you the conclusions.</p>

<p>Every so often I&#8217;ll link in a description of an <span class="knowledge">experiment</span> that backs my claims.  However, my goal here is not to convince you of how the world works. My goal here is to tell you how the world works: there are <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/">plenty of resources</a> on the internet to help you learn the rigorous proofs. I plan to give you the context and the setting by which to understand them.</p>

<aside class="knowledge">
  <p>In a little box that looks like this. This color is for knowledge boxes.</p>
</aside>

<p>In sum, my goal is thus:</p>

<ul>
  <li><span class="simplifience">Tell you what we, the human species, have learned about this strange and beautiful universe in which we live.</span> We have uncovered much of the incredible nature of the universe, but most of our discoveries are hidden behind rigorous proofs in archaic languages.  This is a resource to teach you what we&#8217;ve learned of the universe <a href="/rigor.html" class="stub">without</a> requiring you to understand rigorously how we learned it.</li>
</ul>

<hr class="mark" />

<ul>
  <li><span class="simplifience">Tell it to you on simple, unforgiving terms.</span> I won&#8217;t make concessions to history or poor decisions. I will give things names that make sense in the context that I use them, not names based upon old dead scientists. The names and the terms that I use will <span class="rant">not be compatible</span> with mainstream science and mathematics, but they will be easier to understand.</li>
</ul>

<aside class="rant">
Don't fret, I'll point out places where I'm incompatible. And then promptly ignore them.
