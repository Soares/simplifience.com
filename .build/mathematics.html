				<p>The beginning is Mathematics.</p>

<p>Don&#8217;t panic. Mathematics is a beautiful subject. But if mathematics is like music, we teach mathematics by forcing children to memorize Bethoven&#8217;s sheet music. We won&#8217;t be doing any of that kind of mathematics here.</p>

<!-- TODO: Animating golden ratio loop. Or a fractal. -->

<blockquote>
  <p>Mathematics is beautiful.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Consider: is <span class="rules">312571</span> a prime number?</p>

<aside class="rules">
  <p>Don&#8217;t tell me! I&#8217;d have to pick a new number.</p>
</aside>

<p>Wait! Don&#8217;t go look it up. It doesn&#8217;t matter.</p>

<p>What matters is this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>there is an answer.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#8217;s not an answer that&#8217;s up for debate. 312571 is either prime or it&#8217;s not.  Once I&#8217;ve told you how I write numbers and what &#8216;prime&#8217; means, the answer is out of my hands.
<span class="info">It doesn&#8217;t matter what I <em>want</em> to believe, or how well I argue</span></p>

<aside class="info">
  <p>You&#8217;ll notice this is also a property of reality. No matter how hard you believe you can fly, you can&#8217;t jump off of a cliff.</p>

  <p>However, you <em>can</em> learn the rules and build an airplane. That&#8217;s what this is all about.</p>
</aside>

<p>Mathematics is the art of discovering things that are already decided.  It&#8217;s the art of laying down rules (whatever rules you want) and following those rules to unexpected conclusions.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s fun, if you have a hankering for that sort of thing. It&#8217;s definitely cool.</p>

<!-- TODO: Crazy fractals. -->

<p>And we aren&#8217;t going to do any of it.</p>

<p>You see, that&#8217;s not why we care about mathematics here. Mathematics is fun in the way that any art form is fun, but we&#8217;re here to <span class="simplifience">understand the universe</span>. What does math have to do with that?</p>

<p>It turns out that mathematics has <em>everything</em> to do with it. Math is the language. It&#8217;s the way that everything &#8211; literally everything &#8211; works.</p>

<p>Many people rebel at hearing this. The universe can&#8217;t run on math! What about flowers and emotions and beauty?</p>

<p><img src="/images/flower1.jpg" alt="flower" title="© Hartmann Linge, Wikimedia Commons, CC-by-sa 3.0" /></p>

<p>Those people are looking at it all wrong.</p>

<p>See, the universe follows rules. It&#8217;s these rules that <em>make</em> the universe a universe, and not a chaotic mess where literally anything could happen next.  Without rules, you might wake up tomorrow morning and be a tomato.</p>

<p>We believe we&#8217;re likely to wake up tomorrow, that the sun is likely to rise tomorrow, and that sunrise will still be beautiful tomorrow. These are rules.  And <span class="rules">mathematics is a language for formulating rules</span>.</p>

<aside class="rules">
  <p>An often obtuse language, mind you. That&#8217;s half the reason we&#8217;re here.</p>
</aside>

<p>If we can look at these rules and understand them, we can <a href="/why-understand.html" class="stub">do the impossible</a>. We can predict the world and, even better, <em>explore</em> the world to find out things that are true whether or not we know them yet. We get to uncover the rules, <em>the</em> rules, write them down, and then figure out what things are true.</p>

<p>As you&#8217;ll remember, that&#8217;s what mathematics <em>is</em>.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s no surprise that mathematics describes our world. Mathematics is the description of rules, and <span class="rules">our world has rules</span></p>

<aside class="rules">
  <p>In fact, you could argue that math <em>doesn&#8217;t</em> always describe our world.  Math is constantly struggling to keep up with the incredible rules of the universe as we uncover them.</p>
</aside>

<p>This is why we&#8217;re going to start with mathematics. Mathematics lies at the very core of the understanding of any system: it&#8217;s <em>what we call</em> understanding a system.</p>

<p>Of course, in the world at large, mathematics is much more than that. You can study math for math&#8217;s own sake. You can follow patterns to depths unachievable and chase numbers to the end of infinity. Mathematicians will tell you that <em>that&#8217;s</em> mathematics. And they&#8217;re right.</p>

<p>We only want a little bit of mathematics. We want the parts that describe the rules, the parts that tell us what things are true before we learn them. What we want is <span class="define">simplifience</span>.</p>

<aside class="define">
  <p><strong>Simplifience</strong> <em>n.</em>
1. Describing the rules of existence and extrapolating to learn things that are true.</p>
