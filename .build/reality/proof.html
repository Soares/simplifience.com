			<p>You can&#8217;t prove anything.</p>

<p>Well, that&#8217;s not entirely true. You can prove <span class="maths">many things</span> in mathematics.</p>

<aside class="maths">
  <p>Many things, but not everything. There are
<!--TODO: INTERNALIZE-->
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del's_incompleteness_theorems">true things that can not be proven</a>.</p>
</aside>

<p>But that&#8217;s not very useful, out here in the real world. Sure, you can prove that given certain assumptions about how to write numbers and about what $+$ means, $2+2=4$.</p>

<p>But you can&#8217;t prove that those assumptions <span class="info">apply to the real world</span>.</p>

<aside class="info">
  <p>You can prove that $2+2=4$ but you can&#8217;t prove that two apples + two apples = four apples because you can&#8217;t prove that TODO[apples act like numbers]numbers.</p>
</aside>

<p>No, seriously. You could wake up one morning and realize that <a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/jr/how_to_convince_me_that_2_2_3/">two plus two is three</a>. It&#8217;s not very <em>likely</em>, but it&#8217;s possible.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s <em>possible</em> that the sun will turn into a large chocolate cake tomorrow.</p>

<p><img src="/images/cake.png" alt="Cake" /></p>

<p>Now, it&#8217;s not possible under the current laws of physics. If the sun is a cake tomorrow, physics is pretty much out the window. Either you&#8217;ve gone mad or the universe has been <span class="info">lying to you the whole time</span>.</p>

<aside class="info">
  <p>Perhaps you&#8217;re in a simulation.</p>
</aside>

<p><span class="info">In other words</span>, we&#8217;ve found out a bunch of rules for how things work, and as far as we can tell they&#8217;re invariant. But that doesn&#8217;t mean that they will <em>remain</em> invariant.</p>

<aside class="info">
  <p>We believe that the universe will continue being predictable because it always has been, which is
<!--TODO: INTERNALIZE-->
<a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/s0/where_recursive_justification_hits_bottom/">quite an assumption</a>.</p>
</aside>

<p>Now, I&#8217;m not saying that you should panic. We understand the universe very well, and we&#8217;re pretty sure that the laws of physics will continue to hold tomorrow.</p>

<p>But we can&#8217;t <em>prove</em> it.</p>

<p>Because nobody can ever prove anything. You should <span class="wrong">never</span> be certain of anything in the real world. If you&#8217;re absolutely certain of a thing, then no amount of evidence can ever convince you otherwise. If the universe turns out to be a simulation and things start getting weird, that may place you in an uncomfortable situation.</p>

<aside class="wrong">
  <p>100% certain isn&#8217;t even a thing we should be able to say.
<!--TODO: INTERNALIZE-->
<a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/34547557/log-probability.pdf">There are alternative phrasings</a>.</p>
</aside>

<p>It is a common saying that science can never prove a thing true, it can only prove things false. We can&#8217;t prove anything positively. We can only rule out bad ideas, never single out good ones. But you must remember that even when we prove something false, we prove it false <em>once</em>, at one place in time. Even that, we can not trust. There is always a chance, however minuscule, that the universe was lying to us the whole time.</p>

<p>One possible reaction to this fact is to never use definitives in speech. This is a pretty silly solution, and hobbles our ability to use the language. We wouldn&#8217;t be able to say &#8220;Sally is going to the movies&#8221; any more. We&#8217;d have to say things like &#8220;Sally wants to go to the movies&#8221;, or &#8220;Sally has stated her intent to attend the movies&#8221;, and even then we run into trouble. By the time we utter &#8220;I am reasonably certain that I heard Sally state her intent to attend the movies&#8221;, we&#8217;ve lost something in translation.</p>

<p><img src="/images/movies.jpg" alt="Movie Theater" title="© Pumain, Base Mérimée, French Ministry of Culture" /></p>

<p>It is stupid to throw out definitives in our language. Rather, since the word &#8220;is&#8221; or the phrase &#8220;will be&#8221; <em>cannot</em> be certainties, we use them to express things that <em>we, the speaker</em> believe are true with a reasonable degree of certainty.</p>

<p>With that in mind, know this: I will not refer to things as theories here. I will not say &#8220;scientists are fairly certain&#8221;. I will not qualify reasonably certain uncertainties.</p>

<p><span class="info"><em>Everything</em> is uncertain</span>. Nothing can be proven.</p>

<aside class="info">
  <p>Indeed, you should never treat anything that I say as true, but rather as TODO[evidence about the truth]intro/trust.</p>
</aside>

<p>Even so, there are some things that are well established. I will discuss them as facts, because they are facts. Just keep in mind that all facts can be overturned in time.</p>
