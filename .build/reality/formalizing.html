				<p>If you&#8217;ve ever tried write, you might have noticed that the words in your head don&#8217;t always transfer easily onto the paper. Even if you&#8217;re not a writer, you&#8217;ve undoubtedly experienced occasions where thoughts that seem perfectly clear in your head come out completely differently when you say them aloud.</p>

<p>Articulating your thoughts is difficult. When you write them down or say them aloud, you&#8217;re forced to make them real. You don&#8217;t even realize how patchy your thoughts are until you write them down and the words force you to fill them out.</p>

<p>When you write down your thoughts they become less nebulous. The become more real. Words hold more power than inarticulate thoughts in your mind.</p>

<p>But words aren&#8217;t the end of the line. <a href="/language/scope.html">Words can say many things</a>. It&#8217;s hard to narrow them down. It&#8217;s easy to say words, but it&#8217;s hard to be <em>precise</em>.</p>

<p>Formalizing your words makes them an order of magnitude more powerful. Just as speaking words gives them form, formalization makes that form solid.</p>

<p>Formalization is the act of whittling down the meaning of your words until you only say one thing. It&#8217;s the act of exploring all of your unexplored assumptions. It&#8217;s about considering everything that you took for granted.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s no hard line between a formal explanation and an informal explanation. Formality is a gradient. Proof is a social construct: <a href="/reality/certainty.html">there is no such thing as absolute certainty</a>; a proof is merely any argument that convinces experts in the field.</p>

<p>Writing an argument in math notation does not constitute formalization. It&#8217;s possible to have hand-wavy math, and it&#8217;s possible to have precise words. A <a href="/reality/formalization.html">formal notation</a> is a powerful tool for formalizing your words, but it is not a necessity.</p>

<p>Indeed, the power of a formalized theory stem from the tenants of <a href="/ratience/introduction.html" class="stub">ratience</a>, which tell us that a precise theory holds far more weight than a vague theory. It is one thing to wave our hands and say &#8220;electrons do not have absolute position: their position is distributed over space&#8221;. This may be true, but it is far too vague to be satisfactory. It is another thing entirely to say &#8220;the position of an electron acts precisely like this:&#8221;, and then provide equations.</p>

<p>These theories inhabit the same domain, but the latter is far more precise than the former. The latter provides <em>equations of motion</em>, and if we ever see an electron move differently then we stop believing the latter theory immediately. The former claim is far less falsifiable. It&#8217;s not entirely clear what it means for a position to be distributed over space. It&#8217;s not clear what the implications of the statement are, or how to falsify it.</p>

<p>In accordance with ratience, we place <em>far</em> more confidence in the latter theory, so long as it is correct.</p>

<p>Formalization is the art of narrowing your theories down. It&#8217;s the art of making your claims <em>precise</em> so that you can better test your theory&#8217;s correctness.</p>

<p>A vague theory is better than nothing, but a precisely correct theory wins every time. The universe is precise. It follows precise rules. If we are to discover the rules of reality, we must learn to be just as precise as reality.</p>
