				<p>Suppose your child asks you what a rainbow is. Do you resort to cold, boring science and answer &#8220;diffraction through raindrops&#8221;? Or do you give her a hint of magic while she&#8217;s still young, and tell her that rainbows are fairy roads to leprechaun gold?</p>

<p><img src="/images/rainbow.jpg" alt="Rainbow" title="Â© Marcin Klapczynski, Wikimedia Commons" /></p>

<p><a href="/science/image.html">Science has an image problem</a>. In the modern era, it feels like science is the boring old authority that tells you the way things are. &#8220;Rainbows are just diffraction&#8221;, science insists, and you&#8217;re not allowed to argue. There are no fairies &#8211; science has stripped the world of them.</p>

<p>Science started out as a rebellion against tradition and authority. It started out as a quest to listen to reality when she spoke of her nature, instead of listening to the insistence of ignorant humans. But then science <em>did</em> discover how the world works, and now <em>it&#8217;s</em> the boring authority.</p>

<p>Perhaps <a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/p0/to_spread_science_keep_it_secret/">the best way to spread science would be to keep it secret</a>. For science is not an authority that demands rainbows be boring: science is about discovering how rainbows <em>actually work</em>. It&#8217;s about cracking a mystery. In that regard, science education is about spoiling all the mysteries before anyone has a chance to get curious about them.</p>

<p>To make matters worse, when science spoils the mysteries it doesn&#8217;t often communicate the beauty. We train students to <a href="/reality/passwords.html" class="stub">recite the right passwords</a> to science questions &#8211; like &#8220;diffraction of sunlight through raindrops&#8221; &#8211; before they really understand the conclusion. We make them memorize the syllables before they see the tight interweaving of light and color, of raindrops and prisms.</p>

<p>When science runs around spoiling all the endings, it&#8217;s easy to feel jaded. Rainbows <em>looked</em> like they were fairy paths to leprechaun gold, and now we know they&#8217;re &#8220;just&#8221; diffraction. It doesn&#8217;t matter if you don&#8217;t really understand diffraction: you&#8217;ve been told what you have to answer, and you&#8217;ve been told that the answer can&#8217;t be fairies.</p>

<p>The mystery feels gone, <a href="/reality/magical.html">even if it isn&#8217;t</a>. It feels like science took something away. It&#8217;s easy to feel that science stripped the world of magic, leaving the universe a duller place.</p>

<p>But it&#8217;s not science that stole the fairies from the sky. That was done by reality.</p>

<p>Fairies don&#8217;t actually exist. Science did not kill them: <em>they were never there</em>. Reality is the one that stripped them, by dint of non-existence.</p>

<p>Hercules is not in the stars. Rainbows are not fairy roads to leprechaun gold. There are no gnomes in the gardens. <em>This is not the fault of science</em> &#8211; this is the way things are. This is how reality turned out to be.</p>

<p>Science doesn&#8217;t strip the beauty from the world. Science didn&#8217;t strip the constellations from the sky. Science didn&#8217;t empty Mount Olympus of its gods. Quite the opposite: when reality began to look like it had no magic, <a href="/reality/beauty.html">science restored the wonder</a>.</p>
