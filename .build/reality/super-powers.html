				<p>Why learn how the universe works?</p>

<p>Well, native curiosity, for one thing. You know how kids can&#8217;t stop asking why?
You used to be a kid once. What happened to that feeling? I bet it&#8217;s still
somewhere deep inside of you, if you dig far enough.</p>

<p><em>Why</em> are we here? What&#8217;s up with this whole <span class="info">existence</span>
thing, anyway?</p>

<aside class="info">
And don't say 'religion'. Until we have proof, I'm not going to stop
looking for the real answers. They'll probably surprise us.
</aside>

<p>If that&#8217;s not enough reason to motivate you, consider what knowledge of the
universe has given us so far. We can fly around the entire planet in a single
day and with minimal effort. We can contact friends halfway around the world in
the space of a thought. We can convene a symphony in our ears on demand and live
long lives without fear of disease.</p>

<p>We&#8217;ve literally discovered magic. Ask anyone from two millennia ago: we are
wizards. Only, it&#8217;s not magic to us. Why not?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Because we understand it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And the universe only gets more interesting. Did you know that you can time
travel <span class="rigor">to the future</span>? That you can fly to the center of
the galaxy in half a second, even though it&#8217;s 27,000 light years away? That
gravity isn&#8217;t a force?</p>

<aside class="rigor">
Faster than usual, I mean. It's fairly easy to travel to the future at the
normal rate of one second per earth second.
</aside>

<p>We don&#8217;t understand the universe yet, not deeply, but we understand <em>far</em> more
than most people think. Misconceptions abound. People are still confused about
very well-established facts, thinking that they&#8217;re still the <span class="science">sticking
points</span> of modern physics. Most people don&#8217;t even <em>know</em> the
open questions that humanity faces down every day.</p>

<aside class="science">Entanglement and uncertainty, for instance. Don't worry, they'll be
intuitive by the time we're through.</aside>

<p>It doesn&#8217;t help that these incredibly cool revelations are hidden behind opaque
walls of confusing scientific history and literal millennia of scientific cruft.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s no way to make new discoveries.</p>

<p>We can see far because we stand upon the shoulders of giants.</p>

<p><img src="/images/giantshoulders.jpg" alt="Upon a giant" /></p>

<p>Imagine how far we could see if the giants were not so stooped?</p>
