				<p>We live in a world full of magic and nobody seems to notice. Humans fly through the skies. We send thoughts halfway around the world in the space of a second. We possess miracle cures for many ailments. And somehow we don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s magic.</p>

<p>Sure, our spells don&#8217;t look quite like the spells you&#8217;ll find in storybooks. Constructing the grand factories necessary to build airplanes was no easy task, and it feels like magic shouldn&#8217;t require such busywork. But find me any wizard in the storybooks, be they Merlin or Dumbledoor, and they&#8217;ll surely tell you that creating a new spell is no easy task. The magic happens after the spell is created. It takes a lot of elbow grease to <em>make</em> a spell, but once you make it anyone can flick their wrist and invoke it. There&#8217;s a <em>nnap</em> and a flash of light and suddenly &#8211; you&#8217;ve captured a perfect image of the world on your cell phone.</p>

<p>Yet somehow our magic doesn&#8217;t satisfy the imagination. It feels tooâ€¦ mundane.</p>

<p>Perhaps it feels mundane because it&#8217;s merely real. Except <a href="/reality/mere.html" class="stub">reality is not mere</a>! The fact that something is real does not take away from its power. Indeed, a thing <em>must</em> be real to have impact. If you cannot be satisfied with all that <em>is</em>, you&#8217;d better get used to dissatisfaction.</p>

<p>Or perhaps our magic feels mundane because it can be understood. It can be understood by <span class="info">anyone</span>, no less. Anyone could pick up a textbook and learn how a light bulb works, if they wanted to. This strips science of its mystery &#8211; or does it?</p>

<aside class="info">
  <p>I am glad we do not live in a world where only a select few people were randomly chosen to wield magical power.</p>
</aside>

<p>In every story filled with magic, there are those who understand how it works. There are wizards who pore over their books and study long and hard to understand their powers. They toil and sweat. They practice and they learn, and only upon the moment of understanding are they finally able to preform their grand spells.</p>

<p>Is that so different from our own reality? The magic in the movies may seem opaque to you, the viewer. But surely the wizards understand what they are doing, at least to some degree. Surely they do not play with fire <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan_Project">any more readily than we do</a>. To the wizards in stories, magic is not a mysterious fource: it is a tool which they know how to wield. It is something that can be understood.</p>

<p><a href="/reality/beauty.html" class="stub">The fact that something can be understood does not make anything less wondrous</a>.</p>

<p>Imagine a world where we <em>did</em> discover magic. &#8220;True magic&#8221;, as a modern youth might claim, raised on Harry Potter books and completely devoid of the perspective of a medieval peasant. Magic where you can wave a wand and say a word and turn your uncle green, or levitate through the roof.</p>

<p>If that actually happened in this world, we wouldn&#8217;t all throw down our textbooks and shout &#8220;magic is real!&#8221;. No, we&#8217;d say &#8220;well isn&#8217;t that funny&#8221;. We&#8217;d scratch our heads and wonder &#8220;hey, how did that work?&#8221;</p>

<p>If &#8220;hard magic&#8221; was discovered, we wouldn&#8217;t try to hide it away. We wouldn&#8217;t try to rationalize it away. Rationality can&#8217;t make things go away: rationality uncovers the truth. If you could wave a wand and make it rain toads, we&#8217;d be <em>very very confused</em> &#8211; and then we&#8217;d figure out how it worked.</p>

<p>We&#8217;d summon toads again and again and observe the impact. We&#8217;d find out exactly how the toads appeared in the sky. We&#8217;d record exactly how long it took to get too tired to repeat the spell, and we&#8217;d record exactly how long it took to rejuvenate. We&#8217;d find out precisely which words invoked the toadstorm. We&#8217;d find novel uses for it: could we use the toads to feed starving people? Can we rain frogs instead?</p>

<p>If we found magic, we wouldn&#8217;t label it &#8220;magic&#8221; and give up. We&#8217;d approach this new mystery like we&#8217;ve approached all other mysteries in the past. We&#8217;d figure it out.</p>

<p>Once we&#8217;d figured it out, it would be just another domain of science. For science is the study of what is real: if magic were real, it would be science.</p>

<p>And magic <em>is</em> real. We found it. The fact that it&#8217;s real doesn&#8217;t make it mundane. <a href="/reality/magical.html">If you don&#8217;t understand how something works, then it works by magic</a>.</p>

<p>Magic let transmit our voices through the air. Magic let us traverse the depths of the oceans. Magic let us <em>stand on the moon</em>.</p>

<p><img src="/images/moon.jpg" alt="Moon walker" /></p>

<p>Only we don&#8217;t call it magic. We just call it &#8220;reality&#8221;. Because reality is all there is.</p>
