				<p><a href="/probability/certainty.html">You can&#8217;t be certain of anything</a>.</p>

<p>Even when you think you&#8217;ve proved something, there&#8217;s a small chance that your proof was incorrect. There&#8217;s a small chance that your memories are wrong. There&#8217;s a small chance that your logic is flawed. There&#8217;s a small chance that you&#8217;re literally insane, and there&#8217;s an even smaller chance that the universe has been lying to us the whole time and that the very foundations of logic are about to change.</p>

<p>There are simple proofs that $2 + 2 = 4$, and it looks logically intuitive. The visual proof that $&bull;&bull;$ near $&bull;&bull;$ is $&bull;&bull;&bull;&bull;$ seems irrefutable.</p>

<p>And yet, you may wake up tomorrow and find that <a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/jr/how_to_convince_me_that_2_2_3/">two plus two is three</a>.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s not very <em>likely</em>, but it&#8217;s possible.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s <em>possible</em> that the sun will turn into a large chocolate cake tomorrow.</p>

<p><img src="/images/cake.png" alt="Cake" /></p>

<p>Don&#8217;t misunderstand me. There&#8217;s not a &#8220;quantum chance&#8221; that the sun could turn into a cake tomorrow. The sun <em>cannot</em> turn into a cake tomorrow according to the known laws of physics.</p>

<p>But there&#8217;s a chance that the known laws of physics are just an elaborate hoax and reality&#8217;s been lying to us since the beginning.</p>

<p><span class="info">In other words</span>, we&#8217;ve found out a bunch of rules for how things work, and as far as we can tell they&#8217;re invariant. But that doesn&#8217;t mean that they will <em>remain</em> invariant.</p>

<aside class="info">
  <p>We believe that the universe will continue being predictable because it always has been. This is
<!--TODO: INTERNALIZE-->
<a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/s0/where_recursive_justification_hits_bottom/">difficult to justify</a>.</p>
</aside>

<p>Now, I&#8217;m not saying that you should panic. We understand the universe very well, and we&#8217;re pretty sure that the laws of physics will continue to hold tomorrow.</p>

<p>But we can&#8217;t <em>prove</em> it.</p>

<p>Nobody can ever prove anything. You should never be certain of anything in the real world. If you&#8217;re absolutely certain of a thing, then no amount of evidence can ever convince you otherwise. If the universe turns out to be a simulation and things start getting weird, that may place you in an uncomfortable situation.</p>

<p>It is a common saying that science can never prove a thing true, it can only prove things false. We can only rule out bad ideas, never single out good ones. But you must remember that even when we prove something false, we prove it false <em>once</em>, at one place in time. Even that, we can not trust. There is always a chance, however minuscule, that the universe is about to change the rules.</p>

<p>One possible reaction to this fact is to never use definitives in speech. This is a pretty silly solution, and hobbles our ability to communicate. We wouldn&#8217;t be able to say &#8220;Sally is going to the movies&#8221; any more. We&#8217;d have to say things like &#8220;Sally wants to go to the movies&#8221;, or &#8220;Sally has stated her intent to attend the movies&#8221;, and even then we run into trouble. By the time we utter &#8220;I am reasonably certain that I heard Sally state her intent to attend the movies&#8221;, we&#8217;re missing the point.</p>

<p><img src="/images/movies.jpg" alt="Movie Theater" title="© Pumain, Base Mérimée, French Ministry of Culture" /></p>

<p>It is stupid to throw out definitives in our language. Rather, since the word &#8220;is&#8221; or the phrase &#8220;will be&#8221; <em>cannot</em> be certainties, we use them to express things that <em>we, the speaker</em> believe are true with a reasonable degree of certainty.</p>

<p>With that in mind, know this: I will not refer to things as theories here. I will not say &#8220;scientists are fairly certain&#8221;. I will not qualify reasonably certain uncertainties.</p>

<p><span class="info"><em>Everything</em> is uncertain</span>. Nothing can be proven. But some things are well established and strongly supported. I will discuss them as facts, because they are facts. Just keep in mind that no facts are certain, and all evidence can be overturned in time.</p>

<aside class="info">
  <p>Indeed, you should never treat anything that I say as true, but rather as <a href="/reality/trust.html">evidence about the truth</a>.</p>
