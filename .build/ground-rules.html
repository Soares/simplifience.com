			<p>Here&#8217;s the ground rules:</p>

<p>I&#8217;m going to tell you about the universe.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m going to do it in a web page that looks like this.</p>

<p>Sometimes there will be pictures. Some of them are published under the creative commons license with attribution required. Hover over the image to see the attribution.</p>

<p><img src="/images/lightning.jpg" alt="Lightning!" title="Not this one! This is public domain." /></p>

<p>Now, on to the content of the site:</p>

<p>First and foremost, you should know that <em>I will be wrong</em>.</p>

<p>Sometimes I will be wrong <span class="rigor">on purpose</span>, just for a little while, to make things simpler. I&#8217;ll correct these mistakes as I go along.</p>

<aside class="rigor">
In which case I'll tell you about it in the side commentary.
</aside>

<p>Sometimes I will be wrong because human knowledge is incorrect. <a href="/prove-it.html" class="missing stub">Nothing can be proven true</a>, and there&#8217;s always the possibility that <a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/jr/how_to_convince_me_that_2_2_3/">things aren&#8217;t what they seem</a>. Time and again, science has <span class="knowledge">proven our knowledge wrong</span>, and we&#8217;ve had to adapt. That may, and likely will, happen again.</p>

<aside class="knowledge">
Note that established science is superseded, not discarded. When we found out that our theory of gravity was wrong, we didn't stop sticking to the planet.
</aside>

<p>But most importantly, sometimes I&#8217;m going to be wrong because I&#8217;ve made an error, <span class="info">either in my own understanding</span> or in my presentation. When that happens, and you notice it, <em>please</em> <a href="mailto:nate@simplifience.com">let me know</a>.</p>

<aside class="info">
I plan to cover a wide range of topics here, and some of them are a little out of my weight class.
</aside>

<p>Until then, I&#8217;m going to be speaking in a concise, confident tone for the sake of simplicity. Where there are multiple interpretations, I am going to pick the one I find simplest and run with it. I am not going to teach any <span class="info">controversies</span>. <a href="/rigor.html" class="stub">Rigor is not my goal</a>.</p>

<aside class="info">
Though I may mention them in the side commentary.
</aside>

<p>As you&#8217;ve noticed by now, there&#8217;s going to be side commentary going on in
colored boxes. Different colors mean different things. The <span class="info">teal boxes</span> are neutral commentary.</p>

<aside class="info">
Hello there!
</aside>

<p>These side boxes are <span class="knowledge">experiment boxes</span>.</p>

<aside class="knowledge">
They'll tell you about experiments you can do to see something for yourself.
</aside>

<p>We also have <span class="rules">math boxes</span></p>

<aside class="rules">
Where you can often find links to more rigorous proofs.
</aside>

<p>There&#8217;s the <span class="caution">caution box</span></p>

<aside class="caution">
Careful! Don't make the same mistake that many others make!
</aside>

<p>Then there&#8217;s <span class="define">definition boxes</span>, which are very important. Keep an eye out for them.</p>

<aside class="define">
In these I define uncommon words and new phrases that I've made up.
</aside>

<p>We have <span class="rigor">rigor boxes</span>.</p>

<aside class="rigor">
Here I let you know when I've been lying for the sake of simplicity.
</aside>

<p>Perhaps most importantly, we have <span class="rant">rant boxes</span> where
I discuss something that pervades common mathematics and science which is
nevertheless a <em>bad explanation</em>. They&#8217;re wrong as in confusing, not necessarily
wrong as in incorrect.</p>

<aside class="rant">
$\pi$, $i$, $p=mv$, $e^{i\pi}=1$.
<br />
The force of gravity.
</aside>

<p>I won&#8217;t explain the wrong things in my main articles, nor will I explain why
they&#8217;re wrong. I don&#8217;t want to muddle the point. Red boxes are your indication
that the mainstream has something muddled.</p>

<p>On occasion I&#8217;ll write a <span class="info">refutory</span> article targeting one particular point of contention with the mainstream. In general, though, the policy is to ignore the confusing terminology entirely.</p>

<aside class="info">Refutory articles will have angry headers. You'll recognize them.</aside>

<p>And, finally, we have <span class="simplifience">simplifience boxes</span>. They&#8217;re my favorite.</p>

<aside class="simplifience">
Where I point out concepts that embody the spirit of simplifience.
</aside>

<p>Don&#8217;t <span class="info">memorize</span> these. The purpose of the box will be quite clear from the context. I just like stating the rules before I dive into things.</p>

<aside class="info">
Don't memorize anything! Memorization is silly.
