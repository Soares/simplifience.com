<p>Mathematics is a beautiful thing.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ve heard that before. You likely don&#8217;t believe it. Most of you have been poorly introduced to mathematics by a teacher who was <em>also</em> poorly introduced to mathematics, and you didn&#8217;t get a good first impression.</p>

<p>Modern math education is akin to teaching music by forcing students to memorize Beethoven&#8217;s fugues. It&#8217;s a disgrace and a tragedy, considering the beauty of the subject.</p>

<p><img src="/images/julia.png" alt="Fractal" /></p>

<p>Mathematics can be used to generate pretty images as seen above, or beautiful <span class="info">flowers and sunsets</span> as found in nature. And yet, these do not possess the true beauty of mathematics. Mathematics is found in the structure of beauty, surely, but the beautiful things themselves are not math. A song is beautiful when you listen to it, but you cannot listen to math.</p>

<aside class="info">
  <p>The human concept of beauty is tightly intertwined with math and symmetry.</p>
</aside>

<p>But if the beauty of math is not the beauty of a power, then whence math&#8217;s power?</p>

<p>It helps to understand what I mean when I say the word &#8220;mathematics&#8221;. The word means different things to different people. To you it may evoke simple arithmetic, memorized multiplication tables, or the triangles and circles of geometry. It may invoke statistics, graphs, or fractals such as the one pictured above. Or perhaps it means absent-minded professors and people who sit around thinking all day.</p>

<p>These are things that the word &#8220;math&#8221; evokes. But what <em>is</em> mathematics?</p>

<p>Mathematics is a simple thing. Mathematics is <em>the rules</em>.</p>

<p>The universe we live in is ordered. There are things that we expect to happen, and things which we do not expect to happen.</p>

<p>There is quite a bit of chaos in our universe, of course: but our expectations are dominated by order. We believe that tomorrow will follow today. We believe that the sun will continue shining, the plants continue growing. We <em>don&#8217;t</em> believe that a pink elephant will pop out of the sky, the world will be made of bananas, and the sun will turn out to be a chocolate cake.</p>

<p>When we wake up in the morning we expect to find ourselves in a universe still ordered very much like the universe we went to sleep in. Consider how extraordinary that belief is! There are mind-bogglingly many configurations of all of the matter in the universe. If you were to pick a state of the universe at random, it would almost certainly be a crazy incoherent mess of all the energy. When you wake up in the morning, you don&#8217;t expect the molecules in your arm to be floating near Venus. You don&#8217;t expect your mother to be spread in tiny pieces across the stars.</p>

<p><em>You expect tomorrow to be <span class="info">very similar</span> to today.</em> These are <em>rules</em>. And when there&#8217;s rules, it&#8217;s helpful to know what they are. When humans were growing up on the ancestral savannas, they had to know that when rocks went up they eventually came down. They had to know how to throw a spear. They had to learn the rules of hunting, the rules of socializing, the rules of politicking. The world is dependable, and it&#8217;s much easier to survive if you know exactly what you can depend upon.</p>

<aside class="info">
  <p>In the grand scheme of things. Even if the world is wiped out by an asteroid tomorrow, it&#8217;s still more similar than a random distribution of all matter throughout the entire universe.</p>
</aside>

<p>In fact, understanding the rules of the universe is the primary tool of humanity. It allowed us to build everything from simple tools to grand coliseums to space ships and computers. When you know the rules you can find their edges and push the limits of the possible.</p>

<p>Mathematics is the art of studying the rules.</p>

<p>Any time you write the rules down, that&#8217;s mathematics. Here&#8217;s the beautiful thing about mathematics:</p>

<p>[Cool geometry problem]</p>

<p>The answer doesn&#8217;t matter right now. The beauty of mathematics is that <em>there is an answer</em>.</p>

<p>The answer is not up for debate. It does not care what I believe. <em>Once I have laid down the rules</em>, I have narrowed down the answer.</p>

<p>And here&#8217;s the second beauty of mathematics: Even when it is I who laid down the rules, and even if I understand them perfectly, <em>I can ask questions of those rules of which I do not know the answer</em>. The rules can teach me things. Knowing the rules does not automatically allow me to know what the rules say: but they allow me to find out.</p>

<p>This is <span class="define">mathematics</span>. Any time you find something with rules and you write those rules down, that&#8217;s mathematics. This is how mathematics reveals itself in music and flowers and fractals: mathematics is just <em>rules</em>. It is a formal description of anything ordered.</p>

<aside class="define">
  <p><strong>Mathematics</strong> <em>n.</em> Formalized rules.</p>
</aside>

<p>I grow confused when people say that they do not like mathematics. This is akin to saying that they do not like order, that they do not like living in a universe that follows rules. Unfortunately, our education system teaches mathematics by making students memorize boring rules. Unfortunately, the language by which we commonly formalize our rules is old and crufty and full of gotchas.</p>

<p>But <em>mathematics is not arithmetic</em>, and <em>mathematics is not the crusty symbols we use to describe it</em>. Mathematics is <em>any</em> rules that describe a system.</p>

<p>Don&#8217;t shirk from mathematics. <em>Any time you describe how anything works</em>, you&#8217;ve just used mathematics. Don&#8217;t be confused by the <span class="info">silly symbols</span> that you often find in textbooks. <a href="/reality/symbology.html" target="_blank" class="stub">These symbols are not mathematics</a>!</p>

<p>They are <span class="info">one notation</span> for mathematics: a notation that we will oft ignore.</p>

<aside class="info">
  <p>An old notation invented long before anyone <a href="/math/archaic.html" target="_blank">knew what they were doing</a>.</p>
</aside>

<p>Hate the silly old math notation, if you like. Hate &#8220;math&#8221; education that thinks memorization of the rules is a good substitute for exploring them. But don&#8217;t hate math itself.</p>

<p><span class="define">Mathematics</span> is just a description of anything which works.</p>

<aside class="define">
  <p><strong>Mathematics</strong> <em>n.</em> Formalized rules.</p>
</aside>

<p>Some people like making up their own rules and then <a href="/math/beauty.html" target="_blank" class="stub">seeing what happens</a>.</p>

<p><img src="/images/julia.png" alt="Fractal" /></p>

<p>This can be both fun and rewarding in its own right, and it&#8217;s what math professors do. Simplifience is mostly concerned with the real world, so we&#8217;ll be exploring the rules that apply to reality.</p>
