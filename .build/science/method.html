				<p>Popular culture holds that science is the study of refrigerators and radios and space and all those other cool things that are pretty complicated when you take them apart.</p>

<p>This isn&#8217;t exactly correct. Science is a <span class="info">method of thinking</span>.</p>

<aside class="info">
  <p>Science has had many meanings throughout the ages, sometimes multiple at once. In the context of simplifience it refers to the scientific process for accumulating knowledge.</p>
</aside>

<p>The scientific way of thinking <em>brought</em> us knowledge of refrigerators and radios and space, but those things are not science. Science is a way of looking at the world.</p>

<p>Humans have always tried to explain the world by making up stories that fit our observations. Some of these stories are, in retrospect, pretty silly. Due to quirks in human minds, <a href="/bias/agent.html" class="stub">a thunder god feels more likely than the equations of electricity</a> as an explanation for lightning. It feels easy to imagine a thunder-god, because human brains are very good at empathizing with human-like agents. It feels hard to learn the equations of electricity, because or minds simply aren&#8217;t optimized for such things.</p>

<p>So we made up stories. Sometimes we believed the stories that best explained the data, the stories that felt the most &#8220;right&#8221;. Usually, though, a society just picked a story and ran with it until it became a central governing religion.</p>

<p>The old explanations failed to impress. Alchemy remained beyond our reach, and astrology was forced into making vague predictions so as to avoid falsification. And yet, the stories of old had grown a life of their own. The ego of humans had sprung up around the stories, and suddenly the stories were carrying more weight of explanation than reality itself.</p>

<p>Socrates was tried for impiety. Galileo was <a href="http://books.google.com/?id=wKCZFJuMCaQC&amp;printsec=frontcover">found guilty</a> of holding an opinion probable even though it was contrary to scripture. The problem wasn&#8217;t limited to religion: politics, tradition, and the status quo all took precedence over actually listening to reality.</p>

<p>The dawn of modern science encapsulated the realization that we should let reality speak for itself.</p>

<p>Science is about ignoring the petty squabbles of politics, religion, and tradition. It&#8217;s about stepping back and <em>asking reality</em> what is true, without bias. Keep what reality enforces, discard the rest. Do an experiment, and then (this part is very important) <em>accept the results</em>.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s all science asks of you.</p>

<p>The early modern scientists realized that a human can rationalize pretty much anything <a href="/bias/hindsight.html" class="stub">in hindsight</a>. They demanded that any model of the world make predictions <em>in advance</em>, and thus expose itself to falsification. Humans are great at making up excuses post facto &#8211; your model could only be trusted if it could predict things we didn&#8217;t already know. If a model makes no predictions then it&#8217;s just a <span class="info">label for your own confusion</span>.</p>

<aside class="info">
  <p>A lesson that was <a href="/science/mistakes.html" class="stub">difficult even for science</a>.</p>
</aside>

<p>A scientific theory must also be <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability">falsifiable</a>. Indeed, the power of a theory stems from what the theory <em>disallows</em>, not what it allows.  <a href="/probability/ignorance.html" class="stub">A model which explains everything explains nothing</a>. Models need to expose themselves to reality if we are to trust them. If a model is not falsifiable then it&#8217;s just a label for ignorance.</p>

<p>The revelation of science was that humans can sit in their armchairs all day long arguing about philosophy and the right interpretation of past events, but if you <em>actually</em> want to know how reality works you have to go outside and <em>ask reality</em>.</p>

<p>This sounds <a href="/reality/obvious.html" class="stub">obvious in retrospect</a>, but it was a big deal at the time. The idea that theology and philosophy have less say over how reality works than reality itself was neigh heretical for most of human history.</p>

<p>This promotion of reality over human stories triggered the scientific revolution. It led to radios and space ships and computers. It&#8217;s one of the most important ideas in history.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, it&#8217;s <a href="/science/failings.html">not good enough</a>.</p>
