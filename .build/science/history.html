				<p>Simplifience plans to <a href="/science/right-first.html">teach you the right way first</a> instead of dragging you through the <a href="/science/mire.html">confusions of the past</a>.</p>

<p>We won&#8217;t just blaze through the ancient discoveries: we&#8217;ll skip them. We will correct the confusions that diverted scientists for decades or centuries and teach a perspective that makes the conclusions obvious. You never need to know that we were confused. You don&#8217;t need to see the incredible difficulties that scientists overcame when discovering the true nature of the universe from an incredibly <a href="/reality/narrow.html" class="stub">narrow vantage point</a>.</p>

<p>This is the only way to break the cycle of ignorance. Our cultural subtext supports the classical view of physics, making it hard to learn the new view without technical arguments. Only the most motivated students put in the effort to learn the technical arguments and the new view remains mysterious to the laypeople. The cultural subtext maintains the classical view.</p>

<p>We can break this cycle by teaching the revelations of science without subjecting students to the hard work and confusion required to find those revelations.</p>

<p>This sounds nice from the perspective of scientific literacy, but any scientist worth their salt should be gravely concerned with this suggestion.</p>

<p>Science has made <a href="/science/mistakes.html" class="stub">many mistakes</a>. Humans love their mysteries. They like to label parts of reality &#8220;sacred&#8221;, and say &#8220;these cannot be explained&#8221;. They love to put labels on things that they don&#8217;t understand, so they can feel like they understand them.</p>

<p>Each human has a way that they think reality is, and they feel like they must defend their world view no matter how reality is. They easily forget that an idea which permits everything <a href="/probability/ignorance.html" class="stub">explains nothing</a>. Humans are trained to defend their ideas, and they feel like they have to defend their model against the evidence instead of <em>listening</em> to the evidence and choosing the model that fits it best.</p>

<p>In short, humans are very bad at science. Humanity has erred before, and those errors led us down twisted paths. Perhaps there is merit in teaching the results of science to the masses, but if you arm scientists with knowledge before they know how to wield it the results could be disastrous indeed. Teaching the <em>frame of mind</em> of science is more important than teaching the <em>results</em> of science. It&#8217;s imperative that students understand the missteps of history, or they are doomed to repeat them.</p>

<p>Yet simplifience will still teach the right things first, for three reasons.</p>

<p>Firstly, we must remember that our culture is not a clean slate. There is merit in making students discover things for themselves instead of memorizing the results, but this task is made much harder if you start from a society that reinforces a subtly wrong world view. To repurpose an old adage:</p>

<p><strong>Q. How long does it take to learn relativity?</strong><br />
<em>A. One week. Or a month, if you already know classical mechanics.</em></p>

<p>Language and culture subtly reinforce the classical view. Students don&#8217;t start from ignorance: they are handicapped before they begin learning. Handicapped by unclear answers from their parents and from elementary school teachers who also never learned the corrected world view.</p>

<p>Secondly, though the lessons of history are valuable, there are better ways to teach them that don&#8217;t involve muddling the true nature of the universe. There are many revelations in science, many places that it runs counter to human intuition. It is important to teach people that reality doesn&#8217;t always act how they think it does, but this lesson can be taught without propagating myths to all but a select few promising students.</p>

<p>Finally, it is completely true that the history of science is of extraordinary value to scientists &#8211; but not everybody is a scientist. Any aspiring scientist should learn in depth the mistakes of the past. They should learn the backwards order in which we discovered the rules. They should be made aware of all the human biases and trained to defend against them. They must be put on guard against the temptation to defend a hypothesis and taught how to put down their egos and listen to nature.</p>

<p>This is true of all <em>scientists</em>, but not of all people. This training belongs in a history of science class.</p>

<p>Such information is scientist training, but it is not part of the rules of the universe.</p>

<p>Once we learn truths about the world, those truths should be presented in the simplest way possible. We needn&#8217;t teach knowledge in the order we discovered the knowledge: human discovery is a winding and convoluted journey.</p>

<p>Scientists may find value in the arduous journey, but <em>everyone</em> takes value from better knowledge of The Rules. Consider: there were many lessons to be had in learning that the world is round, but we do not begin a student&#8217;s education by teaching that the world is flat.</p>

<p>The lessons of the past have their place, but those who wish to teach the raw rules of reality must drop the burden of history and teach only the simplicity of nature.</p>
