<p>Science textbooks make it a habit to teach you the wrong things first.</p>

<p>The equations of motion taught in a introductory physics courses are <em>wrong</em>. We know they&#8217;re wrong. There are experiments that show they&#8217;re wrong.</p>

<p>Furthermore, <em>we know the right equations</em>. We have equations that describe motion much better than the ones that are usually taught first.</p>

<p>This topic is ripe for <a href="/reality/status-quo-defence.html">status-quo defence</a>. People say that relativity and quantum mechanics are too hard and we have to teach the old ways first.</p>

<p>This is hogwash. Relativity and quantum mechanics <em>completely</em> revolutionized the way we look at the world. Perhaps these subjects are too advanced for the average layperson, though I don&#8217;t believe that for a moment. But <em>even if they are</em>, classical mechanics is surely not the ideal introduction.</p>

<p>Just because we discovered classical mechanics first doesn&#8217;t mean we should still teach it first. Relativity being difficult does not imply that classical mechanics is a better place to start.</p>

<p>When seven bind scientists discover that what they thought was their World Tree is actually the leg of <a href="/allegory/trunk.html">The Great Elephant</a>, they may rightly claim that elephant biology is too advanced for the laymen. <em>But that doesn&#8217;t mean you should keep talking about the World Tree.</em></p>

<p>Classical mechanics is like in-depth study of the &#8220;World Tree&#8221;. It&#8217;s like making students examine the roots (actually fingernails) and bark (actually skin) in minute detail. These details <em>are useful</em>. The details of classical mechanics are the foundations of trains, cars, and planes. But there&#8217;s a bigger picture, and classical mechanics <em>totally</em> misses it.</p>

<p>You don&#8217;t need to know the details of World Tree theory before you can understand that it&#8217;s actually the elephant&#8217;s leg.</p>

<p>The problem runs deeper than this, though. When you suggest teaching relativity and quantum mechanics <em>first</em>, everyone gets up in arms. &#8220;Those subjects are too crazy&#8221;, they say, as if they didn&#8217;t live in a relativistic quantum mechanical world. &#8220;Those subjects are too hard&#8221;, they protest, as if they can&#8217;t be broken up into bite-sized chunks and understood individually.</p>

<p>Relativity and quantum mechanics <em>are</em> hard to learn, but they&#8217;re mostly hard to learn because it&#8217;s hard to train your brain to be precise. Relativity is hard, but <em>classical mechanics is hard to</em>. It&#8217;s not like everybody on the planet is born with built-in knowledge just above the Newton-level. Learning the rules of classical physics is difficult: perhaps <em>more</em> difficult, because there are Questions You Aren&#8217;t Allowed To Ask in classical physics &#8211; questions that shatter classical physics and lead you to relativity.</p>

<p>When we take people through the difficult process of formalizing their mind and learning how actual rules act, we do them a disservice by starting with classical mechanics. We have them assume things that are not true. We say &#8220;assume it&#8217;s an immobile tree trunk&#8221;, when really it&#8217;s an elephant&#8217;s leg. We aren&#8217;t starting with Isaac Newton in every classroom. Classical mechanics is not completely intuitive, for if it were, it would have been discovered long before. We have to <em>build</em> an intuition for classical mechanics by building up this entire formal world view: a world view which is <em>wrong</em>.</p>

<p><em>This</em> is why relativity seems so hard to learn. Half the population never makes it past classical mechanics. They have difficulty training their mind to be precise and they just think that science is hard. The other half of the population has their head filled with subtly wrong things. They have this whole ivory tower that classical mechanics has constructed, this new way of looking at the world. Then they have to undergo a world-shattering shift in perspective in order to understand relativity and quantum mechanics.</p>

<p>We build up the foundations, and then we make them tear them down and start over.</p>

<p><em>This</em> is why relativity looks hard to learn. People who are good at physics don&#8217;t get to learn relativity from scratch: they have to learn things the wrong way first, then unlearn them, then relearn them. Unlearning and relearning is difficult, so the people who are good at physics feel like relativity is harder that classical mechanics.</p>

<p>And everyone else &#8211; the average layperson &#8211; sees the people they thought were <em>good</em> at physics struggling with relativity, and they say &#8220;Woah, I could never handle that stuff&#8221;.</p>

<p>To adopt an old adage:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Q. How long does it take to learn relativity?</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>A. One week for a complete newbie. One month if you already know classical mechanics.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We still live in a culture where most people don&#8217;t know about the elephant yet. People run around saying things that are technically true but completely mistaken. They say &#8220;Did you hear that there are actually <em>four</em> World Trees?&#8221; They think it&#8217;s meaningful when they say &#8220;scientists say that the <em>true</em> trunk of the World Tree isn&#8217;t even <em>connected</em> to the World Tree. How can the trunk not be connected to the tree?&#8221;</p>

<p>The social model of physics is still classical mechanics, even though classical mechanics has been refuted for nearly a century. People still say things like &#8220;did you hear you can&#8217;t go faster than the speed of light?&#8221; People still think it&#8217;s meaningful to say things like &#8220;what if a rocket ship was going 99.9% the speed of light?&#8221; The problem isn&#8217;t that they don&#8217;t understand the math &#8211; the problem is that they don&#8217;t understand the <em>concepts</em>. And it&#8217;s no surprise. High schools build up this broken world view and parents teach it to their children &#8211; so <em>of course</em> it&#8217;s hard to break the established world view.</p>
