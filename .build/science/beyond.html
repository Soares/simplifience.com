				<p><a href="/science/failings.html">Science isn&#8217;t strong enough</a>. It&#8217;s a brilliant idea that was good enough to sustain civilization for centuries, but it&#8217;s not fast enough. It only asks you to discard wrong theories, it does not help you pluck right ones from the unknown. If we are to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risks_to_civilization,_humans,_and_planet_Earth#Artificial_intelligence">survive</a> the <a href="http://intelligence.org/files/IE-EI.pdf">future</a>, we&#8217;re going to need something better.</p>

<p>Fortunately science, like many scientific theories, has been eclipsed.</p>

<p>Science asks us to listen to evidence when it shouts at us, falsifying our theories. If we are to do better, we must learn to listen to the evidence even when it whispers.</p>

<p>Science can only distinguish between theories that are false and theories that are not yet false. If we are to step beyond science, we require tools to assess the <em>degree of likelihood</em> of a theory.</p>

<p>Fortunately for humanity, such a method has been invented. Unfortunately, it&#8217;s been invented piecemeal throughout the past few centuries across many disciplines. The death knell for science has tolled, but few were there to hear it.</p>

<p>If you want to do better than science, you need new sets of tools. You need tools that allow you to asses the likelihood of a theory, and update that likelihood when new evidence comes in. You need to master the tools of probability.</p>

<p>Armed with the tools of probability, you need a way to discriminate between theories. You need a way to <span class="info">strip theories down to their core</span>, to discard the refuse of the past. You need to pare a theory down to its leanest bones and believe <em>only that</em> &#8211; for to believe anything else is to subject yourself to human bias. You need to master the tools of information.</p>

<p>If you cannot wield the tools of probability you will find yourself believing nonsense long after the evidence has turned against you.</p>

<p>If you cannot wield the tools of information then you&#8217;ll find yourself believing historical baggage akin to gravity-angles, which drive the earth around the sun in exact accordance to the laws of gravitation.</p>

<p>Fortunately for us, these tools exist. We can transcend science. We can do better.</p>

<p>Take science. Add <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_probability">Bayesian probability theory</a>. Add a dash of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_theory">information theory</a>. Stir.</p>

<p>These techniques are not new. These ideas are well-known, well-tested, and vetted.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the method of applying these tools in tandem does not have a short, catchy name. Each tool was invented separately with cautious precision. They never achieved their fame. There was no inquisition to overturn and no authority to buck. They were invented silently and without fuss.</p>

<p>Nobody sounded the horns when science was eclipsed: the new method crept up slowly and took over. Now it rules, though the rest of the world does not yet know it. Science has been overtaken, and the successor <span class="info">has not even been named</span>.</p>

<aside class="info">
  <p>There are some who call the movement <a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/1to/what_is_bayesianism/">Bayesianism</a>. Simplifience avoids this term in part because it neglects the import of information theory, but mostly because it&#8217;s derived from <a href="/intro/names.html">the name of a dead man</a>.</p>
</aside>

<p>Henceforth, this post-scientific method shall be knows as <span class="define">ratience</span>. Science led us out of our confusion and into the enlightenment. Ratience is the next step.</p>

<aside class="define">
  <p><strong>Ratience</strong> <em>n.</em>
A method for discovering true things. Ratience is a successor to science which incorporates information theory and probability theory.</p>
</aside>

<p>Science was good. It still is &#8211; but we can do better. Like many scientific theories, science has been eclipsed by a stronger theory. Ratience encompasses science and then steps beyond. Science, like many of its successful theories, must be consigned to the annals of history.</p>

<p>Science has our fondest memories, but it is the past. <a href="/ratience/introduction.html" class="stub">Ratience</a> is the future.</p>
