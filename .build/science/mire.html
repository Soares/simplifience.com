				<p>The discovery of the rules of the universe has been an arduous process. We humans interact with a very narrow portion of reality. We only get to see the earth, and we only get to feel the narrow region of the earth that sits enormously high above the world of molecules and enormously far below the world of stars.</p>

<p>The discovery of the rules of the universe has followed a somewhat meandering path. We only get to look at a tiny segment of the middle range of the universe, and we discovered the middle of the rules first. Nine times out of ten, even after we really nailed a rule down we ended up finding a contradiction that sent us back to square one.</p>

<p>Don&#8217;t get me wrong. It&#8217;s a slow and arduous process, but it works. It&#8217;s like seven blind monks discovering an elephant. We may be momentarily confused when one feels the tusks and another feels the leg, but eventually we&#8217;re able to put it all together.</p>

<p><img src="/images/elephant.png" alt="Seven Blind Monks and an Elephant" /></p>

<p>That said, don&#8217;t delude yourself into thinking that the order we discovered science is the order we should teach it.</p>

<p>We discovered science backwards. We started from the middle and worked our way towards the ends. We spent decades confused. We made completely wrong conclusions, and it took us decades to turn ourselves around.</p>

<p>There have been periods of more than thirty years where we have made models and equations that <em>work</em>, but we have no idea why. There was a time when the mantra of scientists was &#8220;shut up an calculate&#8221;. We have been very confused by our models before, and it often takes a long time to make sense of what&#8217;s actually going on.</p>

<p>Once we figure it out, everything falls into place. It all looks simple in retrospect. It fits cleanly into textbooks. Everyone who spent thirty years confused shouts &#8220;eureka!&#8221; and it feels like a great mystery was solved. Everyone wants to immortalize the mystery and the solution in the history books.</p>

<p>The solvers of mysteries teach the mystery and the resolution in the same way they experienced it: a whole lot of confusion followed by a clever resolution. Everyone else keeps teaching science the same way they learned it. Before you know it, a hundred years have passed and we&#8217;re <em>still</em> dragging students through artificial mysteries.</p>

<p>The mystery was not in the phenomena that seemed mysterious. <a href="/reality/mystery.html">Mystery is not a property of reality</a>. The mystery was in the minds of the scientists. The mystery was that we were looking at things backwards. The mystery was our misinterpretation of the nature of the universe.</p>

<p><em>Once we solve the mystery we shouldn&#8217;t teach it</em>. The mysteries and solutions of science belong in a <a href="/science/history.html">history of science</a> class. They have no place in the annals of science.</p>

<p>The fact that human scientists misinterpreted the facts for a few decades is not a feature of the universe. It is a feature of the scientists.</p>

<p>There is no need to drag students of science through the mire of history when we&#8217;re teaching them science.</p>

<p>In fact, the mysteries of science are far easier to understand, far more intuitive, far more obvious, if we correct the misconception before we show them the theories.</p>

<p>In fact, schools should teach all students &#8211; not just science students &#8211; how to avoid the famous misconceptions of science. Even if they don&#8217;t learn the specific scientific theory we can teach them how to avoid the pitfalls of human bias. If we eliminate their bias well enough, the &#8220;hard&#8221; discoveries of science will never appear mysterious. They won&#8217;t even seem hard. They&#8217;ll seem intuitive.</p>

<p>Our scientific knowledge was hard to discover. It required a lot of effort. <a href="/reality/obvious.html" class="stub">Never underestimate the difficulty of coming up with obvious ideas</a>. It wasn&#8217;t enough to learn the rules: we also had to learn how to think about the rules. We had to learn what the rules looked like. We had to learn how to interpret what we were seeing. We had to learn to speak our unspoken assumptions. We had to learn to overcome our biases.</p>

<p>It was hard to discover, but that doesn&#8217;t mean it needs to be hard to learn.</p>
