				<p>Humanity discovered science in a manner analogous to <a href="/allegory/trunk.html">a blind monk discovering an elephant</a>. We stumbled across an extraordinarily <span class="info">narrow part</span> of the universe and ran smack dab into a big thick cylinder that felt like a tree trunk. Imagine our surprise when it turned out to be the leg of an elephant elephant.</p>

<aside class="info">
  <p>I&#8217;m not talking about Earth, the tiny spec in the middle of an astronomically large universe. I&#8217;m talking about the narrow region which towers above the foundational atoms and cowers below the sweep of the stars.</p>
</aside>

<p><img src="/images/elephant.png" alt="Seven Blind Monks and an Elephant" /></p>

<p>The science of the Great Trunk was difficult enough when we thought it was just a tree, when we only studied the skin (and thought it to be bark). If the laws of the universe were complex when we only glimpsed the leg of the elephant, imagine the difficulties of learning elephant biology. No child could <em>possibly</em> be ready to learn elephant-theory until college.</p>

<p>Only the brightest students are ever introduced to elephant theory, and when they are, it&#8217;s harder than they imagined. Circulatory systems and nervous systems and optical systems are just too complex for most of them, and only the best of the best manage to master the theory.</p>

<p>The average layperson sees only their brightest friends attempt elephant theory. Most of them struggle and fail. &#8220;What chance does a layperson like me have?&#8221;, they conclude with despair. &#8220;Reality is just too hard for me to understand.&#8221;</p>

<p>And so the majority of society still believe that the Great Trunk is a tree. Only the best and brightest know it&#8217;s an elephant.</p>

<hr />

<p>Reality is hard to understand. Learning the details can be tough. Training your mind to be precise is difficult.</p>

<p>Even though the underlying rules are simple, incredible complexity flows from those rules. Biology and weather and astronomy all flow from the rules about the underlying physical fields, and knowing how the physical fields work doesn&#8217;t help you build an airplane. Even if you learn the rules, you still have to learn about circulatory systems if you want to be a biologist, or monetary systems if you want to be an economist. Mastering any particular theory is hard, whether it&#8217;s sociology or fluid dynamics.</p>

<p>But you don&#8217;t need to master any subjects before you can be told the true nature of the universe.</p>

<p>You don&#8217;t need to master leg-theory before you can be told that the world tree is actually an elephant.</p>

<p><em>Yes</em>, the universe is difficult to understand. It is complex, just as an elephant&#8217;s brain is complex. But <em>you don&#8217;t need to master leg-theory before you can be told that the world tree is actually an elephant.</em></p>

<p>This is the grandest confusion in modern science education. Relativity and Quantum Mechanics have shattered the old world-view. We&#8217;ve discovered that the <em>background of reality</em> isn&#8217;t what we assumed it was.</p>

<p>Quantum mechanics equations are difficult to reason about. They&#8217;re very abstract and the interesting edge cases concern tiny objects that are seldom visible.</p>

<p>Relativistic equations are very difficult to reason about. They&#8217;re extraordinarily generalized and the interesting edge cases occur in situations far more extreme than anything found on earth.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not proposing that everybody should learn the strange edge cases where quantum mechanics and relativity <span class="info">deviate</span> from classical physics. I&#8217;m not advocating that everybody should learn to apply the equations of relativity and quantum mechanics any more than I&#8217;d argue that everybody should know elephantine neuroscience.</p>

<aside class="info">
  <p>Remember, quantum mechanics isn&#8217;t only about the tiny and relativity isn&#8217;t only about the large. These two theories describe <em>everything</em>. You don&#8217;t need to focus on the large to learn relativity.</p>
</aside>

<p>Relativity and quantum mechanics shifted our understanding of the background of reality. They showed that there is no such thing as absolute motion &#8211; only relative motion. They showed that there is no such thing as absolute position &#8211; position is a fuzzy distribution.</p>

<p>These facts about our reality are not broadly understood. They trickle down imperfectly to the masses. Our teachings of science assume absolute particles absolutely positioned on an absolute backdrop, even though we now know that there are no absolutes. Science education reinforces the shattered world-view because only the best and brightest ever learn the truth.</p>

<p>You shouldn&#8217;t need to wait until people are neurosurgeons to teach them that the world tree is an elephant&#8217;s leg, and you shouldn&#8217;t wait until people master classical mechanics before you teach them that the universe has no absolutes.</p>

<p>This demands more than a change in science education. This demands a change in culture and language as well. But science is where it starts, and it&#8217;s high time we teach students &#8211; even the youngest of them &#8211; that the world tree is actually an elephant.</p>
