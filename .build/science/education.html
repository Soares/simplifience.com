				<p>Science education is broken in much the same way that <a href="/math/education.html">math education is broken</a>.</p>

<p>The sentiment is very similar: it is much more valuable for students to learn how to do science than it is for them to learn the results of science.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the conclusions are not so clear cut. While it&#8217;s easy to say</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We don&#8217;t need people who can apply calculus. We need people who can <strong>invent</strong> calculus.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#8217;s much harder to justify the scientific analog, something like &#8220;We don&#8217;t need people who know how precipitation works. We need people who can <em>figure out</em> how precipitation works.&#8221; This statement is false. Schools should teach students how the world works.</p>

<p>People are inherently curious. We want to know why the rain happens, where thunder comes from, and what the other planets look like. After a long hard battle against the unknown, wielding the tools of science, we know the answers to these questions. We should teach them to our students.</p>

<p>That said, it is <em>much more important</em> that our students learn the <span class="info">methods of science</span>. It is nice for our students to know the names of the elements. However, it&#8217;s far more important that they learn how to query reality. And it&#8217;s <em>absolutely essential</em> that they learn how to listen to reality&#8217;s response.</p>

<aside class="info">
  <p>We would do well to teach not only the scientific method but <a href="/science/beyond.html">the method that supersedes it</a>.</p>
</aside>

<p>That&#8217;s the true message of science. That&#8217;s the philosophy that shook the world.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you want to know how reality works, you have to listen to reality.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You can&#8217;t draw a map of a city by sitting in your room with the blinds closed and thinking really hard about it. <a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/gv/outside_the_laboratory/">In order to draw a map, you have to go outside and look at the territory</a>. This is perhaps the most important lesson of all.</p>

<p>You don&#8217;t get to decide what is true. Reality gets to decide that. It&#8217;s up to you to listen so that you can believe what is true.</p>

<p>This skill is far more difficult than it sounds, and it&#8217;s the skill that we completely miss when we teach students things like precipitation and convection. We teach them to memorize the results of science, but the results aren&#8217;t the important part.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not suggesting that we stop teaching the results of science. The results of science are interesting, and it&#8217;s important that everyone has a good feel for how the universe works. We don&#8217;t need everyone to be a chemist, but everyone should know about molecules. We don&#8217;t need everyone to be a biologist, but everyone should know about DNA.</p>

<p><em>That said</em>, the results aren&#8217;t the important part. In this respect science is like math: the part that we really want to teach must be taught indirectly.</p>

<p>If you want to teach science start by teaching rationality. Don&#8217;t just tell them about mental biases, make them <em>experience</em> mental biases. Demonstrate the <a href="/bias/hindsight.html" class="stub">hindsight bias</a> in person. Don&#8217;t warn them about <a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/gv/outside_the_laboratory/">fake explanations</a>, show them directly how seductive the trap is.</p>

<p>Only once they&#8217;re fully skeptical of their intuitions are they ready to begin.</p>

<p>Then, they&#8217;re going to have to do experiments.</p>

<p>If you want a student to be able to recite the rules of physics then by all means lecture them in physics. But if you want them to <em>learn</em> physics they&#8217;re going to have to figure it out themselves.</p>

<p>In order to teach students the results of science, have them do science. Don&#8217;t tell them the answers and make them take notes. Make them discover the answers for themselves. Give them mysteries and ask them to explain.</p>

<p>The role of the teacher should be to nudge the student in the right direction. We needn&#8217;t <a href="/science/mire.html">drag them through the historical mire</a>. If a student starts down the wrong path, a teacher can point them towards an experiment that falsifies their budding theory. If a student gets stuck, a teacher can point them towards an experiment that will yield a surprising insight.</p>

<p>Reality was not nearly so kind to humanity. We&#8217;ve been side tracked for decades or centuries at a time. A smart teacher directing the experiments can help the students skip all that. With the right pointed questions students should be able to hit all the high points in a few short years.</p>

<p>Misconceptions could be squashed before they took root. Students wouldn&#8217;t just know the theories, they&#8217;d know why all the alternatives failed. They&#8217;d have tried the obvious solutions and seen the fall flat.</p>

<p>They wouldn&#8217;t be subjected to misinformation fueled by misinterpretation: they&#8217;d know exactly what the theory said and what it didn&#8217;t say, because they discovered it on their own. They wouldn&#8217;t misinterpret the <a href="/language/scope.html">malleable words</a>, because they&#8217;d&#8217;ve seen <a href="/reality/symbology.html">the thing that the words describe</a>.</p>

<p>Most importantly, they&#8217;d learn to ask reality for answers. Instead of listening to lectures, they&#8217;d have to design experiments. Instead of taking notes, they&#8217;d watch while their broken intuitions were torn asunder. In order to actually understand the phenomena they explored, they&#8217;d have no choice but to listen to actual reality.</p>

<p>When their experiments succeeded, they&#8217;d experience the elation of discovery which is so absent from science classrooms. And when their experiments failed, they&#8217;d have no choice but to discard their pet theories, to let go of their false beliefs.</p>

<p>This skill, more than any other, is the most important thing that a science education can teach.</p>
