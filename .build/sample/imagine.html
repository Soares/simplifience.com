				<div class="caution">
  <p>This is not a standard simplifience article. It provides minimal intuition for $i$ necessary to understand <a href="/sample/identity.html" target="_blank">Euler&#8217;s identity</a>. Both $i$ and Euler&#8217;s identity are <a href="/intro/contrives.html" target="_blank" class="stub">contrives</a>. As a <a href="/intro/taboo.html" target="_blank" class="stub">matter of policy</a> contrives are not mentioned.</p>

  <p>This article is an exception to that rule. It&#8217;s part of an sequence designed to show how &#8220;difficult&#8221; math can be intuitive when taught from a different point of view. If you already have a good intuition for the complex plane you&#8217;re encouraged to skip this article.</p>
</div>

<p>$i$ is called the &#8220;imaginary number&#8221;, as if all numbers weren&#8217;t imaginary. Let&#8217;s correct that misconception now: $i$ is no more <span class="info">nor less</span> imaginary than any other number.</p>

<aside class="info">
  <p>Note that all numbers are imaginary. Have you ever seen a seven? You can search the deepest reaches of space, but you&#8217;ll never find a wild eight.</p>
</aside>

<p>Consider the number line. We&#8217;ve been filling it in for millennia. First there were only whole numbers. At that point it wasn&#8217;t so much a number line as a collection of number dots.</p>

<div class="number-line"></div>
<aside class="info">
  <p>The number line in ancient times</p>
</aside>

<p>There was nothing in between the numbers, which were <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1E7I7_r3Cw">whole and pure</a>. Fractions came as a shock to everybody and really started filling things in:</p>

<div class="natural-line"></div>
<aside class="info">
  <p>The number line as of 3000 years ago</p>
</aside>

<p>But it didn&#8217;t stop there. A man was allegedly <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippasus">murdered</a> for discovering irrationals. Zero took an <a href="http://yaleglobal.yale.edu/about/zero.jsp">embarrassingly long time to discover</a>. Negative numbers were <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_number#History">extremely controversial</a> and were ignored for quite some time.</p>

<div class="number-line"></div>
<aside class="info">
  <p>A number line riddled with absurd &#8220;negatives numbers&#8221; circa 1759CE.</p>
</aside>

<p>Adding new powers to the number line doesn&#8217;t mean that existing numbers start acting differently. Fractions are useful, but if you if you cut a living friend in half you won&#8217;t have <span class="info">half a living friend</span>.</p>

<aside class="info">
  <p>If you cut your friends in half I doubt you&#8217;ll have <em>any</em> living friends.</p>
</aside>

<p>The add-ons to numbers are useful <em>only when they apply</em>. Negative numbers are great for counting money, but I bet you&#8217;ve never seen a negative cow. Before you use numbers you have to figure out how much Number makes sense for that specific situation.</p>

<p>We&#8217;ve been jamming new features into Number for ages. It should come as no surprise that there are yet more features we can shove into the poor overburdened number line.</p>

<p>The so called &#8220;imaginary numbers&#8221; are a fairly modern extension. They take the boring old number line and extend it into a <em>number plane</em>.</p>

<!--TODO: number plane.-->

<p>There are many ways to turn the number line into a number plane. You&#8217;ve probably already encountered number planes for things like graphs and charts where you write points in the form $(1, 2)$ or $(x, y)$. Using imaginary numbers is just like using $(x, y)$ pairs. In fact, it&#8217;s identical. The confusing part of imaginary numbers is that we refer to a point on the number plane as <em>a single two-dimensional number</em>.</p>

<!--TODO: cartesian plane-->

<p>The &#8220;imaginary numbers&#8221; are a name for the vertical axis. Together with the original (&#8220;real&#8221;) number line this creates the <span class="info">complex plane</span>. Points on this plane are two-dimensional numbers.</p>

<aside class="info">
  <p>The &#8216;complex plane&#8217; is another poorly named <a href="/intro/contrives.html" target="_blank" class="stub">contrive</a> ignored by simplifience.</p>
</aside>

<p>There are a few different ways that you can construct two-dimensional numbers. This &#8220;complex plane&#8221; is a type of 2D number that is really good at talking about rotation. Rotation (and oscillation) is prevalent in reality.</p>

<p>The complex plane acts how you&#8217;d expect a number plane to act, with <span class="info">one stipulation</span>: multiplication of &#8220;complex numbers&#8221; works by multiplying the magnitudes and then adding the angles.</p>

<aside class="info">
  <p>There are more subtleties to the complex plane which are explored in simplifience proper. We don&#8217;t need them at the moment.</p>
</aside>

<p>For example, try multiplying the normal old horizontal $3$ (three rotated zero turns) by the vertical $2$ (two rotated a quarter turn):</p>

<!--TODO: 3 * 2-->

<p>You get a vertical six.</p>

<p>Now try <span class="info">$4_↺\frac{1}{8}$</span> times $2_↺\frac{1}{8}$</p>

<aside class="info">
  <p>$4_↺\frac{1}{8}$ is notation for &#8220;$4$ rotated by $\frac{1}{8}$ turns&#8221;.</p>
</aside>

<!--TODO: 4 * 2 -->

<p>You get $8_↺\frac{1}{4}$. The complex number plane is a number plane where <em>numbers also have angles</em>. Multiplication scales the numbers and adds the angles.</p>

<p>The cool thing about a number plane is that the number $1$ has gotten a lot more promiscuous. It used to be that we had just one $1$. Now we have a whole bunch of ones at a all the different angles.</p>

<!--TODO: Unit circle-->

<p>By <span class="info">convention</span>, we still refer to the original one $(1_↺0)$ as &#8220;one&#8221;. We have a special name for the vertical one $(1_↺\frac{1}{4})$. That special name is $i$.</p>

<aside class="info">
  <p>A rather ridiculous convention which mainstream simplifience disregards.</p>
</aside>

<p>There&#8217;s nothing special about imaginaries or complex numbers. Whenever we use imaginary numbers, we&#8217;re using a <em>number plane</em> instead of a <em>number line</em>. On this particular number plane, multiplication is done by scaling the lengths and adding the angles. $i$ is a special name for $1_↺\frac{1}{4}$.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s all you need to know about $i$ in order to understand <a href="/sample/identity.html" target="_blank">Euler&#8217;s identity</a>.</p>
