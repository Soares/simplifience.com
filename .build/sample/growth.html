  <p>This is not a standard simplifience article. It provides minimal intuition for $e$ necessary to understand <a href="/sample/identity.html" target="_blank">Euler&#8217;s identity</a>. Both $e$ and Euler&#8217;s identity are <a href="/intro/contrives.html" target="_blank">contrives</a>, which are normally avoided.</p>
</div>

<p>You&#8217;ve probably been taught that $e$ is $2.718&#8230;$ and you might know it has something to do with logarithms. This is a poor way to look at $e$. The true nature of $e$ is simple:</p>

<aside class="info">
  <p>We&#8217;ll move quickly through the derivation of $e$ This sequence is about $e^{\pi i}$, not $e$ itself. The topic of growth will be covered in much more detail in the <a href="/growth/intro.html" target="_blank" class="stub">Growth sequence</a>.</p>
</aside>

<blockquote>
  <p>$e$ is growth.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>$p * e^x$ is math notation for figuring out how much stuff you get if you start with $p$ and grow it at rate $x$.</p>

<p>Imagine you have a colony of 100 bacteria. They each reproduce once per day. At the end of ten days, <span class="info">how many bacteria</span> are there?</p>

<aside class="info">
  <p>Assume immortal super-bacteria.</p>
</aside>

<p>At a first glance, it looks like you&#8217;ll end up with about $100 * 2^{10} = 102,400$ bacteria, because the population doubles ten times. You&#8217;ll actually find over $100 * e^{10} = 2,200,000$ bacteria &#8211; more than twice as much!</p>

<p>Why? Because the bacteria don&#8217;t reproduce in an orderly fashion. They don&#8217;t all suddenly reproduce in the last minute of the day. Some reproduce hours before midnight. Others reproduce at noon, and still others reproduce in the morning.</p>

<p>The new second-generation bacteria born throughout day 1 start reproducing <em>immediately</em>. Some of them manage to squeeze out a child of their own before midnight. Before the end of the first day, you already have a bunch of second-generation and even a handful of <em>third-generation</em> bacteria floating around. Not many, but enough to throw off the numbers. When you compound this effect for ten days, the impact is enormous.</p>

<p>This is called &#8220;continuous growth&#8221;. It happens when something grows and the new growths also start growing. How much impact does continuous growth have? If the growth is continuous enough, can you get <em>infinite</em> growth? If not, what&#8217;s the cutoff?</p>

<p>These are good questions. In order to answer them we&#8217;ll start with something simpler: non-continuous growth.</p>

<p>Consider your bank account. Imagine you get $10\%$ interest per year, to keep things simple. If you start with $100$ dollars in the bank, at the end of the year you&#8217;ll have <span>$</span>110.</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style="text-align: left">Time</th>
      <th style="text-align: right">$</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align: left">January 1st, Year 1</td>
      <td style="text-align: right">$100$</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align: left">January 1st, Year 2</td>
      <td style="text-align: right">$100 + (100 * 10\%) = 110$</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Now imagine that the bank starts paying interest every six months instead of every year. What happens? Instead of adding 10% once, we add 5% twice throughout the year.</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style="text-align: left">Time</th>
      <th style="text-align: right">$</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align: left">January 1st, Year 1</td>
      <td style="text-align: right">$100$</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align: left">June 1st, Year 1</td>
      <td style="text-align: right">$100 + (100 * 5\%) = 105$</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align: left">January 1st, Year 2</td>
      <td style="text-align: right">$105 + (105 * 5\%) = 110.25$</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<aside class="info">
  <p>Notice how adding $5\%$ is the same as multiplying by $1.05$.</p>
</aside>

<p>The second scenario makes more money. A whole 25¢! We&#8217;re rich!</p>

<p>This happens because the second interest payment includes a little bit of interest on the <span>$</span>5 added on June 1st.</p>

<p>We can repeat this to get more money. If we pay out $2.5\%$ interest four times a year we end up with $((((100 * 1.025) * 1.025) * 1.025) * 1.025) =$ <span>$</span>110.38 at the end of the year. That&#8217;s $100$ (the principle) multiplied by <span class="info">$1.025$</span> four times (once for each quarter).</p>

<aside class="info">
  <p>$1.025$ is $100\%$ of the principle plus $2.5\%$.</p>

  <p>$\displaystyle \frac{10\%\ per\ year}{4\ quarters\ per\ year} = 2.5\%\ per\ quarter$</p>
</aside>

<p>If you generalize this to any principle and interest rate you can calculate the growth of your money with the formula $principle * (1 + \frac{rate}{n})^n$, where $n$ is the number of times you compound the money. This reads as &#8220;Take your principle and increase it by an $n^{th}$ fraction of the interest rate, $n$ times.&#8221;</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s see it in action with some simpler numbers. In order to visualize the interest, I want you to pretend that your bank pays you <span class="info">$100\%$ interest per year</span>.</p>

<div class="growth" data-compounds="1"></div>
<aside class="info">
  <p>Your money doubles every time period.</p>

  <p>It&#8217;s compounded once, so you end up with twice as much money.</p>
</aside>

<p>Now watch what happens when we keep the interest rate the same but compound <em>twice</em> every time period:</p>

<div class="growth" data-compounds="2"></div>

<p>You get the same amount of interest on the principle (shown by the teal blocks) but it&#8217;s split into two payments. Then you also get <em>interest on your interest</em> (the blue block). This is the mechanism by which continuous growth can make you rich.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, it can&#8217;t make you infinitely rich. Compounding gives diminishing returns.</p>

<div class="growth" data-compounds="[3, 4, 5, 6, 7]"></div>

<p>There&#8217;s a cap on how much interest your interest can generate, even if you compound with infinitely fine granularity.</p>

<div class="growth" data-compounds="0"></div>

<aside class="info">
  <p>If you want more you&#8217;ll have to increase either your interest rate or your time period: $p * 2.718&#8230;$ is the maximum amount of money you can in a year at an interest rate of $100\%$ per year.</p>
</aside>

<p>It turns out that the maximum amount of growth you can get from <em>continuously doubling</em> for one time period is $≈ 271.8\%$ growth. We call this $e$, and we&#8217;ll learn <em>why</em> it&#8217;s roughly $2.718$ in later simplifience articles.</p>

<p>Remember that the growth of $p$ at rate $x$ compounded $n$ times can be calculated by $p * (1 + \frac{x}{n})^n$, which means &#8220;increase $p$ by an $n^{th}$ fraction of your interest rate $x$, $n$ times&#8221;. $e$ is a name for what happens when we let $n$ get really large:</p>

<p>$\displaystyle p * e^x = \lim_{n \to \infty} p * (1 + \frac{x}{n})^n$</p>

<p>$p * e^x$ is math shorthand for saying &#8220;start with $p$ and grow it continuously for $x$&#8221;. To keep things clear, we&#8217;ll use the notation $(grow\ p\ x)$ instead. When you see $(grow\ p\ x)$ it means &#8220;however much stuff you have if you start with $p$ and grow it continuously <span class="info">for $x$</span>&#8221;.</p>

<aside class="info">
  <p>$x$ is of the form $rate * time$. If you grow <span>$</span>100 continuously at $25\%$ for two years then you&#8217;ll have $(grow\ 100\ 50\%) ≈$ <span>$</span>164.87.</p>
</aside>

<p>This is all you need to know about $e$ in order to understand <a href="/sample/identity.html" target="_blank">Euler&#8217;s identity</a>, which is much easier to understand once you know that $e^{\pi i}$ means $(grow\ 1\ i)$.</p>
