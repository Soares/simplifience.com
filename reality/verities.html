				<p>Reality has rules to it.</p>

<p>No, that&#8217;s not right. Rules were made to be broken.</p>

<p>Reality has <em>laws</em> to it &#8211;</p>

<p>Except that&#8217;s not right either. Laws are just graduated rules. They may have harsher consequences, but they can be broken just as easily.</p>

<p>Reality seems to have something <em>deeper</em> than rules or laws.</p>

<p>Of course, reality does have a whole bunch of rules and laws. &#8220;Trees grow up&#8221; &#8211; that&#8217;s a rule, but it has exceptions. Some trees grow sideways. Maybe &#8220;trees grow towards sunlight&#8221; is a better rule &#8211; or it was, until we grew trees in artificial greenhouses. &#8220;Trees grow towards the light&#8221;? Perhaps they do when left alone, but not when we <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_shaping">shape them</a>.</p>

<p>&#8220;Water is incompressible&#8221; &#8211; this is a great rule for engineers, and it&#8217;s false in extreme circumstances.</p>

<p>Newton&#8217;s law of universal gravitation certainly seemed pretty solid, until we found exceptions.</p>

<p>Are reality&#8217;s rules just like our own? Are they full of exceptions and special cases? Or are there really deeper rules, rules that can&#8217;t be broken?</p>

<p><a href="/reality/simple.html">It doesn&#8217;t look like it</a>.</p>

<p>Every time we&#8217;ve dug deeper in reality we&#8217;ve found better rules. Every time we discovered an exception in a seemingly universal law, we uncovered an even <em>deeper</em> law which looks even <em>more</em> universal.</p>

<p>Every time we find violations in the laws of physics, it <a href="/math/explore.html">shatters our worldview</a>, unifies things we thought un-unifiable, and humbles us with the simplicity of the universe.</p>

<p>And then those <em>new</em> laws look like they&#8217;ve never been violated.</p>

<p>Not once.</p>

<p>Not once in the entire history of time.</p>

<p>These underlying rules are hardly laws &#8211; perhaps we should call them <span class="info">verities</span> instead. These verities are the source of all other imperfect laws. They are the rules that govern <a href="/reality/order.html">this ordered universe</a>.</p>

<aside class="define">
  <p><strong>Verity</strong> <em>n.</em> A fundamental truth from which all truths flow. An axiom of reality.</p>
</aside>

<p>Unfortunately, we can never find them.</p>

<blockquote title="Albert Einstein">
  <p>As far as the propositions of mathematics refer to reality, they are not certain; and as far as they are certain, they do not refer to reality.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A verity is a true rule of reality, one which can never be violated &#8211; and humans are notoriously bad at finding them. More than once, we&#8217;ve thought we had a verity only to watch it slip through our fingers. Even now, the physics that we hold to be fundamental is likely derived from deeper laws. Are <em>any</em> of the laws we know actually axioms of the real?</p>

<p>We cannot know.</p>

<p>The only way to know that something is not violate throughout all time is to watch for all time &#8211; and even then, it is hard to show that a rule could not <em>in principle</em> be violated. Perhaps one day we will uncover the simple rules from which all else springs. Perhaps, if we&#8217;re lucky, it will be come clear to us why those rules are, and no other rules can be. One day, perhaps we will find a way to truly dissolve a &#8220;why&#8221;.</p>

<p>That day, if it comes, is a long way off.</p>

<p>Until then, we can only seek the verities. We can never catch them.</p>

<p>It turns out our universe is poetic.</p>
