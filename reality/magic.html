				<p>We live in a world full of magic and nobody seems to notice. Humans fly through the skies. We send thoughts halfway around the world in the space of a second. We possess miracle cures for aging and ailments. And somehow we don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s magic.</p>

<p>Our spells don&#8217;t look quite like the spells you&#8217;ll find in storybooks. Constructing the grand factories necessary to build airplanes was no easy task, and it feels like magic shouldn&#8217;t require such busywork. But find me any wizard in the storybooks, be they Merlin or Dumbledore, and they&#8217;ll surely tell you that creating a new spell is no easy task. The magic happens after the spell is established. It takes a lot of elbow grease to <em>make</em> a spell, but once you&#8217;re done anyone can flick their wrist and invoke your magic. There&#8217;s a <em>snap</em> and a flash of light and suddenly &#8211; you&#8217;ve captured a perfect image of the world on your cell phone.</p>

<p>Yet somehow our real magic doesn&#8217;t satisfy the imagination. It feels tooâ€¦ mundane.</p>

<p>Perhaps it feels mundane because it&#8217;s merely real. Except <a href="/reality/mere.html">reality is not mere</a>! Being real does not deprive a thing of impact. Indeed, a thing <em>must</em> be real to have impact. If you cannot be satisfied with all that <em>is</em>, you&#8217;d better get used to dissatisfaction.</p>

<p>Or perhaps our magic feels mundane because it can be understood. It can be understood by <span class="info">anyone</span>, no less. Anyone could pick up a textbook and learn how a light bulb works, if they wanted to. And if anyone can learn it, it must not be that interesting. Right?</p>

<aside class="info">
  <p>Who doesn&#8217;t want to be chosen to wield the exclusive mysterious powers of humanity?</p>

  <p>I don&#8217;t. I, for one, am glad we live in a world where <em>everyone</em> can know humanity&#8217;s greatest secrets.</p>
</aside>

<p>Doesn&#8217;t the fact that it <em>can</em> be understood detract from the mystery?</p>

<p>Perhaps it does, but it shouldn&#8217;t. In every story filled with magic, there are those who understand how it works. There are wizards who pore over their books and study long and hard to understand their powers. They toil and sweat. They practice and they learn, and only upon the moment of understanding are they finally able to preform their grand spells.</p>

<p>Is that so different from our own reality? The magic in the movies may seem opaque to you, the viewer. But surely the wizards understand what they are doing, at least to some degree. Surely they do not play with fire <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan_Project">any more readily than we do</a>. To the wizards in stories, magic is not a mysterious force: it is a tool which they know how to wield. It is something that can be understood.</p>

<p>Things do not need to be mysterious to be magical! In every fantastic magical story, the magic is not mysterious to the citizens of that world. If you lived in their world, would you be as bored with their magic as you are bored with ours, just because it could be comprehended?</p>

<p>I hope not.</p>

<p><a href="/reality/mystery.html">Mystery does not grant power</a>. <a href="/reality/beauty.html">The fact that something can be understood does not make it less wondrous</a>.</p>

<p>Imagine a world where we <em>did</em> discover magic. &#8220;True magic&#8221;, as a modern youth might claim, raised on Harry Potter books and completely devoid of empathy for medieval peasants. Magic where you can wave a wand and say a word and levitate through the roof.</p>

<p>If that actually happened in this world, we wouldn&#8217;t all throw down our scientific models and shout &#8220;magic is real!&#8221;. We wouldn&#8217;t burn down the discoveries we&#8217;ve already made. No, we&#8217;d say &#8220;well isn&#8217;t that funny&#8221;. We&#8217;d scratch our heads and wonder &#8220;hey, how did that work?&#8221;</p>

<p>If hard magic was discovered, we <a href="/science/image.html">wouldn&#8217;t try to hide it</a>. We wouldn&#8217;t try to rationalize it away. Rationality can&#8217;t make things go away: rationality uncovers the truth. If you could wave a wand and levitate, we&#8217;d be <em>very very confused</em> &#8211; and then we&#8217;d figure out how you did that.</p>

<p>If we found magic, we wouldn&#8217;t label it &#8220;magic&#8221; and give up. We&#8217;d approach this new mystery like we&#8217;ve approached all other mysteries in the past. We&#8217;d figure it out.</p>

<p>Once we&#8217;d figured it out, it would be just another domain of science. For science is the study of what is real: if magic were real, it would be science.</p>

<p>Being a part of science is not degrading! Being a part of science only means that the thing is real: for science is the study of what&#8217;s really there.</p>

<p>If something must be mysterious in order to earn your wonder, then you aren&#8217;t pining for a world with magic: you&#8217;re pining for a world with stupider humans. No matter what reality looks like, humans will try to understand how it works &#8211; whether you think it&#8217;s magic or not.</p>

<p>In the real world, magic doesn&#8217;t get labeled as such. It gets labeled as science &#8211; but that doesn&#8217;t make it any less magical. If you actually look at our world, you&#8217;ll realize that magic is real. We found it. It lets us build buildings that scrape the very skies. It lets us explore the depths of the oceans. It lets us <em>stand on the moon.</em></p>

<p>The fact that it&#8217;s real doesn&#8217;t make it mundane.</p>
