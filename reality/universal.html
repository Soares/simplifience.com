					The laws of reality are true everywhere. Newton's laws aren't laws of reality: hop on a carousel. To find the real laws you need to find laws that work no matter how you're moving, which way you're facing, or how old you are.

				<p>There are many true things you can say about the universe. Very few of them are laws of physics.</p>

<p>Perhaps you stumble across a red frog. It is accurate to say &#8220;some frogs are red&#8221;. It&#8217;s inaccurate to conclude that all frogs are red. And the redness of frogs is not one of the laws of the universe.</p>

<p>The laws of the universe are the things that are true <em>everywhere</em>, without exception.</p>

<p>If you ever find an exception, then the rule wasn&#8217;t one of the laws. If you ever <em>could</em> find an exception, in principle, then the rule isn&#8217;t one of the laws. <a href="???">LINK TO SOME OF THE LAW ARTICLES ETC</a></p>

<p>The rules of reality are precisely that which is always true, everywhere in the universe, without exception. It doesn&#8217;t matter where you&#8217;re standing, or which direction you&#8217;re looking in. Turning your head doesn&#8217;t change the laws of physics. Going to space doesn&#8217;t change the laws of physics.</p>

<hr />

<p>The universe doesn&#8217;t care about your perspective. It doesn&#8217;t care where you&#8217;re standing. It doesn&#8217;t care whether you&#8217;re moving, or spinning, or doing jumping jacks. All of these things are <em>internal</em> to the universe, and none of them change the underlying laws.</p>

<p>They can change the way you see the laws of physics, certainly. A man on a train seems to be moving fast if you&#8217;re outside the train, and sitting still if you&#8217;re on the train. Changing your perspective can change how things look to you. But it does not change the <em>laws</em>.</p>

<hr />

<p>Newton&#8217;s laws are not laws of physics. If you don&#8217;t believe me, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GiMi-QPt1Xk">get on a carousel</a> and toss a ball around. You&#8217;ll find it angling off in weird directions once thrown, travelling along a curved path from the perspective of you, the rider.</p>

<p>Newton knew this, of course. His equations weren&#8217;t wrong. There are specific situations in which Newton&#8217;s laws look correct. They work when you&#8217;re analyzing spinning things, but not when your <em>are</em> spinning. &lt;&#8211; Sucks.</p>

<p>The point is that <em>there are places in the world where Newton&#8217;s laws don&#8217;t apply</em>. If you&#8217;re spinning around on a caurosel, objects don&#8217;t seem to travel in straight lines. You would disagree with Newton that there are no exceptions to his laws.</p>

<p>And yet, Newton&#8217;s laws seem to be saying something true. Even though objects curve away from you when you&#8217;re spinning, they do so in just such a way that an outside observer would conclude that they were travelling in straight lines. And they curve away from you the same way every time. So while Newton&#8217;s formulation may not be the true laws of physics, they seem like they&#8217;re saying <em>something</em> about how objects travel, if not the full story.</p>

<p>What is the full story? We&#8217;ll get to that. The point of the day is that laws of physics are everywhere true, and Newton&#8217;s laws aren&#8217;t. End of story.</p>

<hr />

<p>The universe doesn&#8217;t care what you think, or where you&#8217;re standing, it keeps acting the same way. It doesn&#8217;t care how fast you&#8217;re moving, it keeps acting the same way. The laws of physics, then, must not depend upon where you are, where you&#8217;re standing, where you&#8217;re looking, or how fast you&#8217;re going.</p>
