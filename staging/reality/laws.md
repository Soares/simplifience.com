title: The Laws
stub: Many laws of reality flow from the verities. Don't get the two mixed up.

Reality follows many <span class="info" markdown="inline">laws</span>. These laws are not to be confused with the @post[verities]reality/verities of reality.

<aside class="info" markdown="block">
The "rules of reality" for all you alliteration fans.
</aside>

The laws of reality tell us about fluid dynamics and aerodynamics and we can exploit them to build airplanes. The laws of reality tell us about molecular and chemical bonds, and we can exploit them to cure disease.

These laws are useful. They are the foundation of engineering. Discovery of those laws jump-started our civilization. These laws of nature are incredibly important, but *they are not verities*.

Do not confuse the laws of nature with the verities of nature. The behavior of air over the wing of an airplane is useful knowledge, but it is emergent from molecular interactions. The rules that govern the structure of molecules are important, but they are emergent from the interplay of individual atoms.

The laws of reality are very important to know in any society built by architecture and engineering.

That knowledge has important uses, but it those laws are not verities. Verities are the bottom of a why -- or at least they are the closet thing to the bottom of a why that we know today. There is a difference between the truths from which all rules flow, and the rules themselves.
