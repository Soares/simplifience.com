Reality has rules to it.

No, that's not right. The word "rules" doesn't describe the way reality works. Rules sound like they can be broken. The fact that if you have $&bull;&bull;$ marbles in your left hand and $&bull;&bull;&bull;$ marbles in your right hand then you have $&bull;&bull;&bull;&bull;&bull;$ all together is not a *rule* -- it's the way things are.

If you're hiding $&bull;&bull;$ extra marbles in your pocket then you haven't invalidated the rule. You've invalidated my sentence, but you haven't created a world in which $&bull;&bull; + &bull;&bull;&bull; = &bull;&bull;&bull;&bull;&bull;&bull;&bull;$

It's hard to even *imagine* a world in which $2 + 3 = 7$. If you take $&bull;&bull;$ and place them near $&bull;&bull;&bull;$ then you have $&bull;&bull;&bull;&bull;&bull;$. The petty little word "rule", which can be broken, does not seem apt to describe this property of the universe.

"Truth" is perhaps a better word. The fact that $2 + 3 = 5$ is a truth. But there are many other things which are truths, but which are not particularly relevant to us. The following is true:

> If all elephants are purple and all purple elephants have penguin riders, then all elephants have penguin riders.

That statement is *true*, but it doesn't feel like it should be placed in the same category as the fact that $2 + 2 = 4$.

We could call the true properties of the universe "facts", but then they're placed in the same bin as facts like "Bill Clinton was president of the USA in the year 1999" -- again, it feels like we should use a stronger word.

The ancients used the word "law" to describe the underlying and fundamental truths of nature. Perhaps their society was different from our own, but in modern times the word "law" is hardly better than the word "rule". Laws, like rules, can be circumvented and broken.

Reality cannot. Even when I say "the rules of reality can't be broken", you *feel* like they can be broken, because rules were made to be broken, as the saying goes.

We need a stronger word to describe the underlying ways that reality works. Here at simplifience, we will refer to the deep underlying truths of nature as <span class="define" markdown="inline">verities</span>.

<aside class="define" markdown="block">
__Verity__ *n.* A true principle of fundamental importance, a truth from which all other truths spring.
</aside>

Verities are truths so deep that we cannot understand the implications of deviation. If we were to wake up and find that $2 + 2$ is now $3$, we would be completely lost. If we took one pair of socks and placed them near another pair of socks and had only three socks, we'd have to *completely start over*.

If we suddenly woke up in a world where $&bull;&bull;$ socks near $&bull;&bull;$ socks is $&bull;&bull;&bull;$ socks, without any socks disappearing, then we'd have *no idea* what would happen when we started with two socks and added one more. If $2+2=3$, then what is $2+1$?

Addition is a verity. It is a truth so deep that if we find a violation of it we have to sit down and re-think *everything*.

Verities are the closest we can get to satisfying a why. If you're wondering why $2 + 2 = 4$ instead of $3$, I can sit you down with two pairs of marbles and <span class="info" markdown="inline">show you</span>.

Humanity has been hunting verities since time immemorable, and we've come up with precious few. Most of the laws of the universe that we have discovered @post[are not verities]reality/laws. Things which we thought were verities have been @post[subverted before]reality/subversion, and we must assume that they will be subverted again. Some of the verities that we have found are @post[counter-intuitive]reality/unintuitive. You can @post[never be certain]reality/certainty that what you have is actually a verity -- you could wake up one day and discover that [two plus two makes three](http://lesswrong.com/lw/jr/how_to_convince_me_that_2_2_3/). You'd just have to live with it.

If that ever happens, we'll conclude that addition was never a verity to begin with. We'll search for the deeper verities that describe how logic changes. @post[We don't have all the verities]reality/unknowns yet: but @post[reality is an ordered place]reality/order, and we aim to learn how it works.
