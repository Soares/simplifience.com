				<p>&#8220;I hate this class&#8221;, Sarah muttered.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s going to be important&#8221;, Rose insisted, fiddling with the lock. &#8220;You&#8217;ve got to open doors every day of your life.</p>

<p>Sarah sniffed. &#8220;Yeah, but I learned how to open house doors and kitchen doors and stuff in like <em>first grade</em>. <em>This</em> stuff is pointless.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Pointless?&#8221; Mary gasped. &#8220;Sarah, there are some very important jobs that require you to know how to open doors.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You can just walk around!&#8221; Sarah cried, gesturing towards the lone door frame squatting in the center of the empty classroom. The sun had just disappeared behind the mountains but nobody&#8217;d turned the lights on yet, so the girls stood in twilight. The door frame creaked a bit as Rose jerked her hand, cursing at the lock as she fiddled with her picks.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yeah, well, you aren&#8217;t going to find just door frames in real life&#8221;, Mary said. &#8220;In the <em>real</em> world, doors are going to be attached to walls.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yeah, but in the real world I&#8217;m also not going to need to pick locks.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What if you lock yourself out of your car?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I&#8217;ll call a locksmith. Or triple A.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mary rolled her eyes. &#8220;You can&#8217;t just use technology to get out of every problem, Sarah. You&#8217;ve got to <em>know</em> this sort of stuff.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Really? Why? I already know how to open house doors. I&#8217;m <em>great</em> at opening car doors. I opened car doors <em>twice</em> in order to get to this stupid practice session that <em>isn&#8217;t even necessary.</em>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And yet I don&#8217;t see you breezing through this lock&#8221;, Rose muttered, hands busy with her lock picks.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can open all the door types I need to&#8221;, Sarah insisted. &#8220;And I bet I <em>could</em> pick that lock in two minutes flat. But it&#8217;s still pointless.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But what about military bunker doors?&#8221; Mary countered. &#8220;Or space shuttle hatches?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If I ever decide to become an astronaut maybe then I&#8217;ll learn how to open space shuttle hatches.&#8221;</p>

<p>Rose snorted again. &#8220;Yeah, like they&#8217;re ever going to accept an astronaut that doesn&#8217;t know how to open space shuttle hatches.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sarah stomped her foot. &#8220;Then I won&#8217;t be an astronaut.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mary rolled her eyes. &#8220;We&#8217;ve still got to prepare people.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s stupid and boring&#8221;, Sarah insisted, &#8220;and we&#8217;re never going to need to know this stuff.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Uh, yeah you are&#8221;, Mary reminded her. &#8220;Anatomy of a Door is on the state exams.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Pop quiz&#8221;, Rose muttered sarcastically, &#8220;essay on how transoms evolved in the last two hundred years.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It doesn&#8217;t matter!&#8221; Sarah practically shouted. &#8220;I shouldn&#8217;t need to know what a transom is in order to <em>open doors!</em>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right, miss genius&#8221;, Mary said, sarcasm dripping from her voice. &#8220;How would <em>you</em> teach door-opening?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t!&#8221; she cried. &#8220;I mean, like, sure, we&#8217;d still show kids how to open doors. When they&#8217;re like, four to six. Teach them how car handles and doorknobs work. But, like, you don&#8217;t really need to <em>teach</em> that in a class. You can just show them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yeah, that&#8217;s hardly going to help the first time they find a garage door with a remote door opener&#8221;, Mary said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Or one of those old garage doors with a string on it&#8221;, Rose chimed. &#8220;Those ones are a doozy. And you can&#8217;t really teach that to little kids, they&#8217;re just not tall enough to open them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So what!&#8221; Sara shouted. &#8220;You teach them to open those doors when they&#8217;re tall enough. They can <em>learn as they go along.</em>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You think we should spend the first half of Shop class teaching kids how to open the garage door?&#8221; Rose protested. &#8220;That&#8217;s not fair to the kids who can already open garage doors by the time they get to Shop class.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yeah, and what if they learn the wrong way?&#8221; Mary piped up. &#8220;What if, like, they come to some double doors and they open the left side instead of the right side like everyone else?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, do they still get in the building?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yeah, but it&#8217;s not compatible with how everyone else is doing it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who cares?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They could, like, be going against the traffic &#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In which case they&#8217;ll use the other side next time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well what if like someone else opens the side that they aren&#8217;t used to opening?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then they walk through it. It&#8217;s not rocket science.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yeah, but if they didn&#8217;t learn to open the left side &#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ll figure it out when they&#8217;re put in context!&#8221; Sarah exclaimed. &#8220;It&#8217;s not that hard!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure, maybe it&#8217;s not hard for <em>you</em>&#8221;, Rose slammed a hand against the door in frustration as one of her lock picks broke. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know what you&#8217;re whining about, you&#8217;re better at door-opening than all of us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That doesn&#8217;t make the class any less stupid!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just because it comes naturally to you doesn&#8217;t mean it comes naturally to everyone. Look how many people are failing this class.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yeah, because this class is <em>pointless</em>. Most people don&#8217;t need to be able to pick a lock or board a space shuttle in their everyday lives.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a life skill&#8221;, Mary shrugged.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is <em>not</em> a life skill!&#8221; Sarah shouted. &#8220;Memorizing all of the different types of doors that the school thinks are important doesn&#8217;t teach you <em>anything</em> about really getting yourself from point A to point B. If we just taught people good motor skills, a bit of dexterity, and a touch of cleverness then they&#8217;ll be able to open any door that&#8217;s in their way and they&#8217;ll <em>also</em> be able to climb through windows, hop over puddles, and cross bridges.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Woah there&#8221;, Rose said. &#8220;I think you give people too much credit. Those are like, Masters level subjects. At least.&#8221;</p>
