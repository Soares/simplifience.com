				<p>&#8220;I hate this class&#8221;, Sarah muttered.</p>

<p>Neither of the other two girls answered. Mary just pursed her lips and tapped her foot. Rose kept fiddling with the lock.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s useless&#8221;, Sarah spoke up louder.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s important&#8221;, Rose insisted, fiddling with the lock. &#8220;You open doors every day.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sarah sniffed. &#8220;Yeah, but I learned how to open house doors in the first grade. Advanced door-opening is pointless.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Pointless?&#8221; Mary gasped. &#8220;Sarah, there are some very important jobs that require door-opening knowledge.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course it&#8217;s pointless&#8221;, Sara gestured to the lone door frame squatting in the center of the empty classroom. &#8220;You can just walk around!&#8221;</p>

<p>The door frame creaked a bit as Rose jerked her hand, cursing at another broken lock pick.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yeah, well, you aren&#8217;t going to find disembodied door frames in real life&#8221;, Mary said. &#8220;In the <em>real</em> world, doors come attached to walls.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yeah, but in the real world I don&#8217;t have to pick locks.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What if you lock yourself out of your car?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I&#8217;ll call a locksmith. Or triple-A.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mary rolled her eyes. &#8220;You can&#8217;t just always rely on technology, Sarah. You&#8217;ve got to <em>know</em> this sort of stuff.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Really?&#8221; Sarah raised an eyebrow. &#8220;Why? I already know how to open house doors. I&#8217;m <em>great</em> at opening car doors. I opened the car door twice on my way to this stupid pointless practice session.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And yet I don&#8217;t see you breezing through this lock&#8221;, Rose muttered, hands busy with a new pick.</p>

<p>&#8220;I bet I could pick that lock in two minutes flat&#8221;, Sara snapped back. &#8220;That doesn&#8217;t mean it&#8217;s not pointless.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But what about military bunkers?&#8221; Mary countered. &#8220;Or space shuttle hatches?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If I ever decide to become an astronaut, maybe then I&#8217;ll learn how to open space shuttle hatches.&#8221;</p>

<p>Rose snorted. &#8220;Yeah, like they&#8217;re ever going to accept an astronaut that doesn&#8217;t know how to open space shuttle hatches.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sarah shrugged. &#8220;They can teach me on the job.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They won&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I won&#8217;t be an astronaut.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve still got to <em>prepare</em> people.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s stupid and boring and we&#8217;re never going to need to know this stuff.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Uh, yeah we are&#8221;, Mary reminded her. &#8220;Anatomy of a Door is on the state exams.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Pop quiz&#8221;, Rose muttered with sarcasm and spite dripping from her tone. &#8220;Essay on how transoms evolved in the last two hundred years.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shouldn&#8217;t need to know what a transom is in order to <em>open doors!</em>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right, miss genius&#8221;, Mary said. &#8220;How would <em>you</em> teach door-opening?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t!&#8221; she cried. &#8220;I mean, sure, we&#8217;d still show kids how to open basic doors. Teach them how car handles and doorknobs work. You don&#8217;t really need to teach that in a classroom. You can just show them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yeah, that&#8217;s hardly going to help the first time they find a garage door with a remote opener&#8221;, Mary said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Or one of those old garage doors with a string on it&#8221;, Rose chimed. &#8220;Those ones are a doozy. And you can&#8217;t really teach that to little kids, they&#8217;re just not tall enough to open them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So what?&#8221; Sara cried. &#8220;You teach them to open those doors when they&#8217;re tall enough. They can learn as they go along.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You think we should spend the first half of shop class teaching kids how to open the garage door?&#8221; Rose protested. &#8220;That&#8217;s not fair to the kids who can already open garage doors by the time they get to shop class.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yeah, and what if they learn the wrong way?&#8221; Mary piped up. &#8220;What if, like, they come to some double doors and they open the left side instead of the right side?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, do they still get in the building?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yeah, but it&#8217;s not compatible with how everyone else is doing it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who cares?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They could, like, be going against the traffic &#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In which case they&#8217;ll use the other side next time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well what if like someone else opens the side that they aren&#8217;t used to opening?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then they walk through it. It&#8217;s not rocket science.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yeah, but if they didn&#8217;t learn to open the left side &#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ll figure it out when they&#8217;re put in context! It&#8217;s not that hard!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure, maybe it&#8217;s not hard for <em>you</em>&#8221;, Rose slammed a hand against the door in frustration as another lock pick broke. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know what you&#8217;re whining about, you&#8217;re better at door-opening than all of us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That doesn&#8217;t make the class any less stupid!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just because it comes naturally to you doesn&#8217;t mean it comes naturally to everyone. Look how many people are failing this class.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yeah, because this class is <em>pointless</em>. Most people don&#8217;t pick locks or board space shuttles in their everyday lives.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a life skill&#8221;, Mary shrugged.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is <em>not</em> a life skill! Memorizing all of the different types of doors that the school thinks are important doesn&#8217;t teach you <em>anything</em> about really getting yourself from point A to point B. If we just taught people good motor skills, a bit of dexterity, and a touch of cunning then they&#8217;ll be able to open any door that&#8217;s in their way and they&#8217;ll <em>also</em> be able to climb through windows, hop over puddles, and cross bridges.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Woah there&#8221;, Rose said. &#8220;I think you give people too much credit. Those are like, Masters level subjects. At least.&#8221;</p>
