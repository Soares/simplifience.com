				<p>Seven blind scientists were in a forest. They were but fledgeling scientists, still new to their art.</p>

<p>They came across a great obstacle in their path, tall and broad and rough and firm and round and towering into the sky. Upon inspection, they knew this to be a tree. They had never seen a tree, nor even felt one, but they could feel its solid power and its rough texture. Everything fit with the stories in their culture of the great world tree that held together earth and sky.</p>

<p>Upon deliberation, they decided to name this great obstacle &#8220;The Trunk&#8221;. They agreed that it mus be the trunk of their world tree. They went back to their towns and cities to make teachings and philosophize happily until the days of their deaths.</p>

<p>Later generations, cursed with the same blindness, discovered anomalies in The Trunk. They never found a single leaf, for instance. When they finally invented <span class="info">flying machines</span> they found not branches in the boughs of this tree, but great broad walls of bark suspended in the sky.</p>

<aside class="info">
  <p>Because blind pilots are a great idea.</p>
</aside>

<p>Following the bark-walls led to far away lands, at which point the Trunk descended back into the earth! These flying blind scientists found three such locations where the world tree burrowed back into the ground. Though they had yet to find the top of the Trunk, they postulated that the Trunk took on a very different shape than their ancestors had assumed.</p>

<p>All this came as quite a shock to the population of blind scientists. The Trunk soared up and over and descended to the earth in many locations. Who ever would have guessed such a thing? Truly, science brought these people the secrets of reality.</p>

<p>Then the trunk shuddered, and bent, and moved.</p>

<p>Within one scant generation, the blind scientists discovered that the Trunk was not a tree at all. It was an enormous ancient elephant.</p>

<p><img src="/images/elephant.png" alt="Seven Blind Monks and an Elephant" /></p>

<p>To this day, the blind scientists teach their children about the great elephant called &#8220;The Trunk&#8221;.</p>

<p>Upon this very morning a curious child raised their hand in a classroom.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why do we call it the trunk&#8221;, this student piped up, &#8220;if it&#8217;s an elephant?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you noticed that long silly nose?&#8221; the teacher replied. &#8220;It&#8217;s a defining feature of elephants, and it&#8217;s called a trunk.&#8221;</p>
