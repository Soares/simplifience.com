Don't trust me.

I mean, I'd appreciate it if you invest social trust in me. I'm here with good intentions to teach you honestly about the nature of reality.

That said, I will be wrong.

I will do my best to be right, but sometimes I will be wrong.

Never trust me completely. Never trust *anyone* completely. Don't even trust your own mind completely. @post[Be skeptical of everything]reality/certainty. Ask why. Find your own reasoning. Keep being skeptical until you find evidence that convinces you, and don't believe *anything* until you're <span class="info" markdown="inline">satisfied</span>.

When someone tells you that a thing is true, that does not mean that the sky is blue. The sky is blue whether or not their words are true. Words do not cause the truth.

If you are an underdweller who has never seen the sky, you can not treat my statement as fact. You can only treat my statement as *evidence*.

If I'm a known pathological liar, my statement is poor evidence. If I'm a close friend who's been Above, my statement is be good evidence. Either way, my words are only evidence about the truth: they are not the truth itself.

This is true regardless of how confidently I talk. It doesn't matter if I say "I'm pretty sure the sky is blue" or "the sky is definitely blue" -- to you, my words are merely evidence.

Even if I am honest and sane, you should not trust me completely. There are many ways for me to be honest, sane, and wrong.

Perhaps I mean well, but I misunderstood what I saw. I am fallible.

Perhaps I understood, but spoke ambiguously. @post[Language is powerful]language/scope and @post[imprecise]language/simplicity.

Even if I am honest, and I understood correctly, and I express my knowledge well, *you* may misunderstand. Minds work differently. Ideas can easily get @post[lost in translation]reality/translation.

Whenever we communicate, there are a dozen ways to transmit the wrong information. I cannot open your mind and pour my knowledge in. *Even if I could*, you should treat it with caution: my knowledge is incomplete, perhaps dangerously so.

Verify what I tell you. Question the parts that sound questionable. Convince yourself, and don't be satisfied until you do. The important thing is not that you believe me: the important thing is that you learn doubt the status quo and question everything.

In the end, you can only trust the things you've found to be true for yourself.
