title: Philosophy of Simplifience
---
Simplifience is founded on three simple ideas:

1. __You don't have to be an expert to learn the revelations of science.__ Over the past century, humans have made many deep discoveries regarding the nature of the universe. These discoveries have deep philosophical implications, but they aren't taught to the general public. Science education only teaches the true nature of reality to students with the mathematical acumen to master the subjects. This is silly: @post[you don't need to be a quantum physicist to learn the worldview painted by quantum physics]science/wrong-first.

2. __Math and science are easier to learn if you discard the historical context.__ Math and science were grown organically. They're chalk full of @post[archaic artifacts]math/archaic. Discovery is a meandering @post[garden path]science/mire: the revelations of science can be taught very quickly by avoiding historical detours.

3. __Reality is not strange.__ Reality always acts normally. Mystery is not in the world: @post[mystery is in you]reality/mystery. If you think the universe is counter-intuitive then your intuitions must change. If you try to understand reality on your own terms it will seem to @post[thwart you at every turn]allegory/axe. But if you can learn to think on @post[reality's terms]reality/terms, if you can make your intuitions match the real world, then even the most advanced math and science will become intuitive.

You *can* understand the deep secrets of the universe. You don't need to be a brilliant scientist or a master mathematician to learn the truths of quantum mechanics and relativity. You can understand them. They can even become intuitive. All you need to do is tweak your intuitions.
