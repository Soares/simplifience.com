There are many concepts in science and mathematics which correct, strictly speaking, but which are still wrong. They're technically correct but confusing and occlusive. Here at simplifience we refer to such concepts as <span class="define" markdown="inline">contrives</span>.

<aside class="define" markdown="block">
__Contrive__ *n.*
A thought, label, or concept which hides what it means to describe.
</aside>

Sometimes contrives place @post[many concepts under the same label]foundations/mathematics. You don't notice that there are two concepts: you think the contrive is one single confusion.

Sometimes contrives label an incomplete concept in a way that makes it sound whole, preventing you from reaching full understanding.

Universally, contrives make simple concepts difficult to understand.

Perhaps the most famous contrive is $\pi$, the radius lengths in half a turn.

<div class="unroll" data-counter="on" data-pistop="on"></div>

$\pi$ alone, while relatively harmless, makes it harder to see the truth in any formula involving circles. Every time you want to describe a turn you have to add an extra factor of two. $\frac{\pi}{2}$ radians is a quarter circle, not a half circle.

I mention $\pi$ because it is a [hotly contested](http://tauday.com/tau-manifesto){:target="\_blank"} contrive with [popular support](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jG7vhMMXagQ){:target="\_blank"}. Yet even poor contrived $\pi$ has its advocates. The other contrives lurking in your brain are far less visible than $\pi$. They hardly seem to matter when taken individually.

Most contrives cannot be attacked head-on. They are familiar and safe and everyone knows what they mean, even if they hide deeper knowledge. When arguing against a contrive the burden of proof is placed upon the challenger. You fight an uphill battle. The contrive is safe and comfortable. Everyone's so used to it that they hardly notice their own efforts to route around the damage. You face the inertia of an entire culture. You're ravaged by a bias in favor of the status quo.

Simplifience takes a different approach: we don't mention contrives. We don't give them the power they're used to. We ignore them.

We do the math and science in the simplest form. We discard the historical cruft. Once you've built up a solid intuition for the subject, once you really understand what's going on, it doesn't matter what notation you use.
