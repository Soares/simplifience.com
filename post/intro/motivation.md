Math and Science are wrong.

<aside class="computer" markdown="block">
There's a special version of this article for @post[computer programmers]computation/motivation.

They're not incorrect, but there are other ways to be wrong.

Math makes @post[three grievous mistakes]math/archaic. Science inherits all the same mistakes and adds @post[two of its own]science/mire. Math and science are riddled with @post[contrives]intro/contrives: confusing names, stale concepts, and viewpoints grown twisted over the millennia.

The net result is a confusing bloated mess. The true nature of existence is obfuscated by archaic languages. The secrets of reality are locked in textbooks guarded by a @post[personhood cult]intro/names.

It doesn't have to be like this. Math and science can be much simpler if you sidestep the cruft of history.

Words are cheap: try an @post[introductory sequence]sample/identity of simplifience if you aren't convinced.

Simplifience is here to teach you about the true nature of existence. Popular culture holds that reality is a very difficult place to understand. Quantum mechanics has a reputation similar to magic and the average physics textbook won't get within ten chapters of general relativity. This is not because the concepts are *intrinsically difficult* -- it's because their presentation is twisted and confused.

We can do better.

Simplifience doesn't assume any particular level of education. It's here for everyone. It's for people who barely passed their high school physics courses but have never lost their curiosity. It's for people who's ears perk up when they hear "quantum teleportation" and "entanglement" and have always wondered what secrets existence is hiding from them. It's for people who took a bunch of physics courses and were good at solving all of the equations the way the teacher wanted, but never really *understood* the motions they dutifully carried out. It's for everyone who's done the math but doesn't understand the *meaning*.

It's a quest to understand the universe.

If you can't wait to start, begin by @post[correcting a few confusions]foundations/unlearn that you aren't aware you have.

Otherwise it's useful to read about @post[how to use this site]intro/site.
