title: It's not good enough.
---
Some people say that math is good enough.

They argue that $\pi$ is fine, even though it's half the circle constant. They argue that using dead people's names for constants isn't that bad an idea, because it's easy to get what it means.

You'll notice that these people are almost exclusively scientists, mathematicians, and engineers.

These are people who have above-average ability to see @post[past the symbols]reality/symbology and understand the meaning. They navigated the minefield of mainstream mathematics with ease and now they can stand on the other side and claim that it wasn't so hard.

The people you don't hear from are everybody who hates math, everybody who failed science. Some of these people just didn't like the subjects: but many more were confused by strange notation and confounded by lost purposes. They beheld a twisted bloated mess that they'd just have to memorize if they wanted to pass the class, and they hated it, and they never came back.

Math and science *aren't* good enough right now. Once you understand enough math to see past the symbols, it doesn't matter what notation you use. But before you undersand what you're learning it's important to make the subjects as simple as possible.

I'm not advocating that we dumb the subjects down: far from it. Rather, I'm advocating that we teach them in their simplest form.

If the simplest form isn't compatible with the ancient notation then one of them has to go.

I know which side I'm rooting for.
