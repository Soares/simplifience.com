title: Formal Notation
stub: |
  Here I discuss formal notation for the rules. You may be familiar with one such notation, known commonly as "Mathematics". The formal notation of simplifience will be inspired by, but not beholden to, that ancient tongue. Influences from other formal languages will also be incorporated. Should probably be moved to the reality sequence.
