title: The Trouble with Names

Which makes sense: "Fourier's transform" or "frequency decomposition"?

"Euler's constant" or "the growth constant"?

"<span class="info" markdown="inline">The reduced Planck and Dirac constant</span>" or "unit momentum"?

<aside class="info" markdown="block">
Or $\hbar$, as if that's any better.

This is getting ridiculous. Names are powerful things. They shape how we think about a concept. [They shape our intuitions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bouba/kiki_effect). The person who discovered a concept has no bearing upon what the concept means!

Don't get me wrong. Discovering new things is great. But if you want to make students learn who discovered which constants, put it in a "History of Math and Science" class.

Names should give you a feeling for what something is. When you hear a name for a new concept, the name should prepare you for the meaning. If the name is taken after an old dead person, all it can do is put your mind in a historical context. The names of scientists are opaque. They tell us nothing about the nature of that which they label.

The names of scientists have no place in the rules of reality. When the goal is understanding, we must call things what they are.

<aside class="info" markdown="block">
Half-jokingly, I propose that we only honor the names of discoverers up until they die. After that, they won't care if we stop using their name.

Which won't work after we fix death.
