title: The Trouble with Names

Which makes more sense:

The <span class="simplifience" markdown="inline">Fourier transform</span> or <span class="info" markdown="inline">frequency decomposition</span>?

<span class="simplifience" markdown="inline">Euler's constant</span> or <span class="info" markdown="inline">unit growth</span>?

<span class="simplifience" markdown="inline">The reduced Planck and Dirac constant</span> or <span class="info" markdown="inline">unit angular momentum</span>?

Even if you don't know what these things are, the <span class="info" markdown="inline">latter</span> names give you a hint. The <span class="simplifience" markdown="inline">former</span> names are worse than useless.

Names are powerful things. @post[They shape how we think]intro/contrives. [They shape our intuitions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bouba/kiki_effect). Names should help us understand the thing they name.

The person who discovered a concept has no bearing upon what the concept means!

Don't get me wrong. Discovering new things is great. The scientists of yore were geniuses who deserve to be recorded in the annals of history. But they should be recorded in *history*, not in science. Science is about understating the universe, not about propagating a personhood cult.

The names of scientists have no place in the rules of reality. When the goal is understanding, we must call things what they are.
