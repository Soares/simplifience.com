title: It's not too late

Perhaps it's too late to change.

Math and science are wrought with @post[contrives]intro/contrives, and perhaps these contrives stand in the way of understanding. But they are centuries, sometimes *millennia* old. Isn't it too late to change?

Well, it's certainly too late if you keep up that attitude. I, for one, am not worried. First of all, you must understand that the point is not to teach you the weird symbols and language that describe math and science. The point is to teach you @post[what the language is saying]reality/symbology. Once you understand the things that the formulas are trying to tell you, it doesn't matter what formulas you use to describe them.

In other words, once you know math it's trivial to change up your notation: which is why many mathematicians think that math is @post[good enough]intro/good-enough.

The place where simplifience makes a difference is in *learning* math and science. If you learn math and science without contrives, it's <span class="info" markdown="inline">easy to pick</span> up the mainstream contrives and understand the existing scientific corpus. But when you're learning math and science, contrived concepts are stumbling blocks.

A huge fraction of our society stumbles on our contrives. Scientific literacy is abysmal, despite science being *really cool*. When teaching these things, simplicity does matter, and it's never too late to make math and science easier to understand.
