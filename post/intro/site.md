title: How to use this site

Welcome to simplifience.

If you get lost, click on the title of the article or the big <span class="uncomfortable">simplifience</span> logo at the bottom of the page. It will take you back to [simplifience.com](/).

Articles are grouped into sequences. You can find a list of all the articles in the sequence at the bottom of the page. Those are links, use them to navigate. Sometimes one article appears in multiple sequences. Keep track of which sequence you're reading when you navigate. Once you reach the end of a sequence you'll see a bunch of other sequences at the bottom of the page.

Within each article, there are <span class="info" markdown="inline">side commentaries</span>, which expand on colored text. <span class="info" markdown="inline">Teal</span> is the standard simplifience color. Other colors have different meanings:

<aside class="info" markdown="block">
Commentary boxes look like this.
</aside>

<div class="rules" markdown="block">
Blue for discussing the @post[rules of a system]reality/rules and pointing to math resources.
</div>

<div class="rigor" markdown="block">
Navy blue for pedantic clarifications.
</div>

<div class="simplifience" markdown="block">
Purple as a secondary voice in example conversations or for elegant revelations.
</div>

<div class="knowledge" markdown="block">
Magenta for discussing experiments and pointing to scientific resources.
</div>

<div class="rant" markdown="block">
Red for ranting about mistakes made by the mainstream.
</div>

<div class="stub" markdown="block">
Orange for content that is not yet completed.
</div>

<div class="caution" markdown="block">
Yellow to caution you about common misinterpretations.
</div>

<div class="define" markdown="block">
Green to define new terminology.
</div>

Don't memorize these. @post[Don't memorize anything]intro/knowledge. The meaning will be obvious in context.

Some articles will take on one of these colors entirely. For example, articles on the @post[nature of science]science/method take on the magenta color. Such articles are introductions to different subjects such as <span class="knowledge" markdown="inline">science</span> and <span class="rules" markdown="inline">mathematics</span>. They're useful articles, but all discussions of the workings of reality will occur in the <span class="info" markdown="block">teal</span> articles.

Articles will have many links in them. [Links](/) will be blue if you haven't visited the linked page and purple if you have. You'll also see some @post[orange links]intro/stub. These link to stubs of articles that are planned but not yet completed.
