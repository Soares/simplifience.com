###What do all the different colors mean?
See the @post[site mechanics]intro/site page.

###Are you serious about this?
Incredibly. Math and science are far harder to learn than they have to be.

###Who says your way is better?
Nobody. But math and science were grown organically over the course of millennia. Nobody knew where they were going, so the notation was hardly designed with forethought.. I have no illusion that my way of teaching math and science is the best possible way -- but I'm confident that it's quite a bit better than the modern method. Even in the fields of math and science, the number of people who know the equations but don't intuitively understand the results is astonishing.

###Your way isn't compatible with the mainstream. Isn't it detrimental to aspiring scientists?
No. If you're memorizing simplifience notation, you might have trouble with mainstream notation. However, the entire point of simplifience is to help you see past the notation to understand the underlying reality. The notation should disappear. Once you understand the @post[that which the symbols symbolize]reality/symbolism, you'll be able to use notation you like.
