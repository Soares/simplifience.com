Knowing something is not about memorizing the equations. It's not about being able to apply formulas. You haven't learned a subject until I can erase the equations from your memories and you recreate them from scratch.

Equations are @post[tools]math/codes to succinctly encapsulate understanding. If you only know the equations, then you're just @post[memorizing passwords]reality/passwords. You don't know the subject until you can create the equations. You don't actually understand a phenomenon until it's intuitive.

@post[There's a big difference between a proof and a why]why. Simplifience is here to teach you the latter. If you want the former, pick up a textbook.
