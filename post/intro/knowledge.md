Knowing something is not about memorizing the equations. It's not about being able to apply formulas. You don't actually understand a phenomenon until it's intuitive.

Formulas and equations are not understanding. You haven't learned the subject until I can erase the equations from your memories and you can re-create them.

The equations are tools to succinctly encapsulate understanding. If you can recreate the equations from scratch, then you poses understanding. But if you only know the equations, then you're just @post[memorizing passwords]reality/passwords.

@post[There's a big difference between a proof and a why]why. Simplifience is here to teach you the latter. If you want the former, pick up a textbook.
