The beginning is Mathematics.

Don't panic. Mathematics is a beautiful subject. But if mathematics is like music, we teach mathematics by forcing children to memorize Bethoven's sheet music. We won't be doing any of that kind of mathematics here.

Consider: is <span class="rules">312571</span> a prime number?

<aside class="rules" markdown="block">
Don't tell me! I'd have to pick a new number.
</aside>

Wait! Don't go look it up. It doesn't matter.

What matters is this:

> there is an answer.

It's not an answer that's up for debate. 312571 is either prime or it's not.  Once I've told you how I write numbers and what 'prime' means, the answer is out of my hands.
<span class="info">It doesn't matter what I *want* to believe, or how well I argue</span>

<aside class="info" markdown="block">
You'll notice this is also a property of reality. No matter how hard you believe you can fly, you can't jump off of a cliff.

However, you *can* learn the rules and build an airplane. That's what this is all about.

Mathematics is the art of discovering things that are already decided.  It's the art of laying down rules (whatever rules you want) and following those rules to unexpected conclusions.

It's fun, if you have a hankering for that sort of thing. It's definitely cool.

<!-- TODO: Crazy fractals. -->

And we aren't going to do any of it.

You see, that's not why we care about mathematics here. Mathematics is fun in the way that any art form is fun, but we're here to <span class="simplifience">understand the universe</span>. What does math have to do with that?

It turns out that mathematics has *everything* to do with it. Math is the language. It's the way that everything -- literally everything -- works.

Many people rebel at hearing this. The universe can't run on math! What about flowers and emotions and beauty?

Those people are looking at it all wrong.

See, the universe follows rules. It's these rules that *make* the universe a universe, and not a chaotic mess where literally anything could happen next.  Without rules, you might wake up tomorrow morning and be a tomato.

We believe we're likely to wake up tomorrow, that the sun is likely to rise tomorrow, and that sunrise will still be beautiful tomorrow. These are rules.  And <span class="rules">mathematics is a language for formulating rules</span>.

<aside class="rules" markdown="block">
An often obtuse language, mind you. That's half the reason we're here.
</aside>

If we can look at these rules and understand them, we can @post[do the impossible]why-understand. We can predict the world and, even better, *explore* the world to find out things that are true whether or not we know them yet. We get to uncover the rules, *the* rules, write them down, and then figure out what things are true.

As you'll remember, that's what mathematics *is*.

It's no surprise that mathematics describes our world. Mathematics is the description of rules, and <span class="rules">our world has rules</span>

<aside class="rules" markdown="block">
In fact, you could argue that math *doesn't* always describe our world.  Math is constantly struggling to keep up with the incredible rules of the universe as we uncover them.
</aside>

This is why we're going to start with mathematics. Mathematics lies at the very core of the understanding of any system: it's *what we call* understanding a system.

Of course, in the world at large, mathematics is much more than that. You can study math for math's own sake. You can follow patterns to depths unachievable and chase numbers to the end of infinity. Mathematicians will tell you that *that's* mathematics. And they're right.

We only want a little bit of mathematics. We want the parts that describe the rules, the parts that tell us what things are true before we learn them. What we want is <span class="define">simplifience</span>.

<aside class="define" markdown="block">
**Simplifience** _n._
1. Describing the rules of existence and extrapolating to learn things that are true.
