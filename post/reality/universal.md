title: Universal Law
stub: "The laws of reality are true everywhere. Newton's laws aren't laws of reality: hop on a carousel. To find the real laws you need to find laws that work no matter how you're moving, which way you're facing, or how old you are."

There are many true things you can say about the universe. Very few of them are laws of physics.

Perhaps you stumble across a red frog. It is accurate to say "some frogs are red". It's inaccurate to conclude that all frogs are red. And the redness of frogs is not one of the laws of the universe.

The laws of the universe are the things that are true *everywhere*, without exception.

If you ever find an exception, then the rule wasn't one of the laws. If you ever *could* find an exception, in principle, then the rule isn't one of the laws. [LINK TO SOME OF THE LAW ARTICLES ETC](???)

The rules of reality are precisely that which is always true, everywhere in the universe, without exception. It doesn't matter where you're standing, or which direction you're looking in. Turning your head doesn't change the laws of physics. Going to space doesn't change the laws of physics.

The universe doesn't care about your perspective. It doesn't care where you're standing. It doesn't care whether you're moving, or spinning, or doing jumping jacks. All of these things are *internal* to the universe, and none of them change the underlying laws.

They can change the way you see the laws of physics, certainly. A man on a train seems to be moving fast if you're outside the train, and sitting still if you're on the train. Changing your perspective can change how things look to you. But it does not change the *laws*.

Newton's laws are not laws of physics. If you don't believe me, [get on a carousel](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GiMi-QPt1Xk) and toss a ball around. You'll find it angling off in weird directions once thrown, travelling along a curved path from the perspective of you, the rider.

Newton knew this, of course. His equations weren't wrong. There are specific situations in which Newton's laws look correct. They work when you're analyzing spinning things, but not when your *are* spinning. <-- Sucks.

The point is that *there are places in the world where Newton's laws don't apply*. If you're spinning around on a caurosel, objects don't seem to travel in straight lines. You would disagree with Newton that there are no exceptions to his laws.

And yet, Newton's laws seem to be saying something true. Even though objects curve away from you when you're spinning, they do so in just such a way that an outside observer would conclude that they were travelling in straight lines. And they curve away from you the same way every time. So while Newton's formulation may not be the true laws of physics, they seem like they're saying *something* about how objects travel, if not the full story.

What is the full story? We'll get to that. The point of the day is that laws of physics are everywhere true, and Newton's laws aren't. End of story.

The universe doesn't care what you think, or where you're standing, it keeps acting the same way. It doesn't care how fast you're moving, it keeps acting the same way. The laws of physics, then, must not depend upon where you are, where you're standing, where you're looking, or how fast you're going.
