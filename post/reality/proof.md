  You can't obtain certainty (though you can get pretty close).

You can't prove anything.

Well, that's not entirely true. You can prove <span class="maths">many things</span> in mathematics.

<aside class="maths" markdown="block">
Many things, but not everything. There are
<!--TODO: INTERNALIZE-->
[true things that can not be proven](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del's_incompleteness_theorems).
</aside>

But that's not very useful, out here in the real world. Sure, you can prove that given certain assumptions about how to write numbers and about what $+$ means, $2+2=4$.

But you can't prove that those assumptions <span class="info">apply to the real world</span>.

<aside class="info" markdown="block">
You can prove that $2+2=4$ but you can't prove that two apples + two apples = four apples because you can't prove that TODO: [apples act like numbers](numbers).
</aside>

No, seriously. You could wake up one morning and realize that [two plus two is three](http://lesswrong.com/lw/jr/how_to_convince_me_that_2_2_3/). It's not very *likely*, but it's possible.

It's *possible* that the sun will turn into a large chocolate cake tomorrow.

Now, it's not possible under the current laws of physics. If the sun is a cake tomorrow, physics is pretty much out the window. Either you've gone mad or the universe has been <span class="info">lying to you the whole time</span>.

<aside class="info" markdown="block">
Perhaps you're in a simulation.
</aside>

<span class="info">In other words</span>, we've found out a bunch of rules for how things work, and as far as we can tell they're invariant. But that doesn't mean that they will *remain* invariant.

<aside class="info" markdown="block">
We believe that the universe will continue being predictable because it always has been, which is
<!--TODO: INTERNALIZE-->
[quite an assumption](http://lesswrong.com/lw/s0/where_recursive_justification_hits_bottom/).
</aside>

Now, I'm not saying that you should panic. We understand the universe very well, and we're pretty sure that the laws of physics will continue to hold tomorrow.

But we can't *prove* it.

Because nobody can ever prove anything. You should <span class="wrong">never</span> be certain of anything in the real world. If you're absolutely certain of a thing, then no amount of evidence can ever convince you otherwise. If the universe turns out to be a simulation and things start getting weird, that may place you in an uncomfortable situation.

<aside class="wrong" markdown="block">
100% certain isn't even a thing we should be able to say.

</aside>

It is a common saying that science can never prove a thing true, it can only prove things false. We can't prove anything positively. We can only rule out bad ideas, never single out good ones. But you must remember that even when we prove something false, we prove it false *once*, at one place in time. Even that, we can not trust. There is always a chance, however minuscule, that the universe was lying to us the whole time.

One possible reaction to this fact is to never use definitives in speech. This is a pretty silly solution, and hobbles our ability to use the language. We wouldn't be able to say "Sally is going to the movies" any more. We'd have to say things like "Sally wants to go to the movies", or "Sally has stated her intent to attend the movies", and even then we run into trouble. By the time we utter "I am reasonably certain that I heard Sally state her intent to attend the movies", we've lost something in translation.

It is stupid to throw out definitives in our language. Rather, since the word "is" or the phrase "will be" *cannot* be certainties, we use them to express things that *we, the speaker* believe are true with a reasonable degree of certainty.

With that in mind, know this: I will not refer to things as theories here. I will not say "scientists are fairly certain". I will not qualify reasonably certain uncertainties.

<span class="info">*Everything* is uncertain</span>. Nothing can be proven.

<aside class="info" markdown="block">
Indeed, you should never treat anything that I say as true, but rather as TODO: [evidence about the truth](intro/trust).
</aside>

Even so, there are some things that are well established. I will discuss them as facts, because they are facts. Just keep in mind that all facts can be overturned in time.
