title: Order

Reality follows rules. It's an ordered place. @post[Be thankful for that]allegory/disorder -- even if you don't like the rules, be glad that there *are* rules. If there weren't rules, the resulting chaos would work in your favor.

You depend upon patterns. More than just social patterns: you depend upon electrons tomorrow working like they do today. You depend upon the sun burning tomorrow like it does today.

There are patterns: they allow life to exist. There is structure: be glad for it.

We can look at the universe and deduce the structure. We can decode the patterns. When we do, we find @post[The Rules]reality/rules.

Anything ordered has rules. It must: order implies structure. The rules don't have to be @post[simple]reality/simple, they don't have to be understandable, but they have to be there. Even if they were complicated beyond human comprehension, they would be there. @post[There is no such thing as mystery]reality/mystery: even if we can't *discover* the structure behind reality's patterns, reality *has* structured patterns.

The laws of reality must operate without exception. Any law that operates *with* exception isn't a @post[verity]reality/verities -- if reality breaks the laws that you think govern the universe, then it turns out they didn't govern the universe after all. If reality provides an exception to what you thought was a rule then the *true* rule includes that exception.

The rules of reality are the ones that fully describe how reality works. Reality can't break those rules, because reality is *contained within* those rules. Whatever reality breaks out of is not reality's container.

We know such rules exist, because reality exists. At minimum, we can point anywhere and say "reality works like that". We know the most complicated set of rules that reality follows, because that's reality itself. If you want to know *exactly* what happens when you throw a rock off of a cliff, there is a *perfect* simulator you can use which will never lie: pick up a rock, toss it off a cliff.

Reality acts however reality acts. <span class="info" markdown="inline">There are constraints</span> on how reality acts: these are the rules. At the very least, reality can be expressed in terms of reality itself.

The fact that reality is constrained @post[does not diminish it]reality/beauty.

It might seem optimistic to hope that reality can be expressed in simpler terms. It may seem impossible to simulate a rock thrown off a cliff, without possessing at least a rock and a cliff.

But we can! That's what it means when we say reality is ordered. *That's what it means for reality to have patterns.* It means that there are parts of reality that *repeat*. There are parts of reality that are based off of other parts of reality. It means that reality *builds off itself* to create those beautiful patterns. There is structure and there is repetition. We can create a *simpler* model, a recipe of sorts, which describes this structure and this repetition. We can understand reality in simpler terms.

By very dint of reality being ordered, there *must* be rules which can express reality in terms simpler than reality itself.

But reality is a very very complicated place. We know that we can express it in rules simpler than itself, but there's no guarantee that those rules are simple enough. There's no guarantee humans can comprehend them.

But from here, it looks like we can. The evidence is in our favor. Humanity seems able to understand reality.

Such is our gift. Let us never squander it.
