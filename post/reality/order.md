title: Order

Reality follows rules. It's an ordered place. @post[Be thankful for that]allegory/disorder -- even if you don't like the rules, be glad that there *are* rules. If there weren't rules, the resulting chaos wouldn't work in your favor.

You depend upon patterns. You depend upon electrons tomorrow working like they do today. You depend upon the sun burning tomorrow like it does today. Patterns allow life to exist. Structure is the foundation of existence.

We can look at the universe and recognized the patterns, deduce the structure. When we do, we find @post[The Rules]reality/rules.

Everything ordered has rules. The rules don't have to be @post[simple]reality/simple, they don't have to be understandable, but they have to be present. Even if they were complicated beyond human comprehension, they would be present. @post[There is no such thing as mystery]reality/mystery: even if we can't *discover* the structure behind reality's patterns, we know that reality does have structured patterns.

The order of reality follows laws without exception. Any law that operates *with* exception isn't a @post[true law of reality]reality/verities -- if reality breaks the laws that you think govern the universe, then it turns out they didn't govern the universe after all. If reality breaks what you thought was a rule then the *true* rule includes that exception.

The Rules of reality are the ones that fully describe how reality works. Reality can't break those rules, because reality is *contained within* those rules. Whatever reality breaks out of is not reality's container.

We know such rules exist, because reality exists. At minimum, we can point and say "reality works like that". There's an upper bound for how complicated reality can be, and that upper bound is reality itself.

If you want to know exactly what happens when you throw a rock off of a cliff, there is a *perfect* model you can use which will never lie: pick up a rock and toss it off a cliff.

Reality acts however reality acts. <span class="info" markdown="inline">There are constraints</span> on how reality acts: these are the rules. At the very least, reality can be expressed in terms of reality itself.

The fact that reality is constrained @post[does not diminish it]reality/beauty.

It might seem optimistic to hope that reality can be expressed in simpler terms. It may seem impossible to simulate a rock thrown off a cliff, without possessing at least a rock and a cliff.

But we can! That's what it means when we say reality is ordered. *That's what it means for reality to have patterns.* There are parts of reality that repeat. The universe builds off of itself to create beautiful patterns. There is structured repetition.

Structured repetition implies we can create a simpler model, a recipe of sorts. By dint of reality's order, there *must* be rules which express reality in terms simpler than reality itself.

But reality is a very complicated place. We know that the rules are less complex than reality itself, but there's no guarantee that they're simple enough. There's no guarantee  that The Rules lie within the grasp of human comprehension.

So I bring you good news: it looks like we can understand reality. The evidence is on our side. The Rules seem to be within our grasp.

Such is our gift. Let us never squander it.
