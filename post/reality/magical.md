If you don't know how something works, then it works by magic.

How does a light bulb work?

How does a car work?

How does a plane work?

How does a computer work?

Don't give me vague, hand-wavy answers. I'm not wondering if you've @post[memorized the passwords]reality/passwords. I'm wondering if you actually *know* how these things work. If you were sent back in time, or if you were removed from the corpus of human knowledge, would you be able to recreate these things?

If not, then it works by magic.

"Magic" is just a word for things that work for reasons you don't understand. It's what powers mysterious items. But @post[mystery is not in the world]reality/mystery: mystery is in *you*. It doesn't matter if somebody else knows how cars work. So long as *you* don't know how cars work, it's magic *to you*.

@post[Magic exists]reality/magic. Humans can do incredible things, and you can't begin to fathom how. I don't care if you're a professional scientist: humans are just too good at too many things. You can't understand them all. The parts you don't understand are magic.

It's a bit hard to see sometimes, in this modern world, how magical things are. Most of the obvious mysteries have already been solved. When your daughters asks what a rainbow is, the answer "light diffracting through rain" sounds a lot less exciting than "a fairy road to leprechaun gold".

It's easy to @post[repeat the words]reality/passwords "diffraction through rain drops". You can form the sounds even if you don't know what they mean, and the syllables sound so cold and dry. They don't *sound* colorful. It's harder to understand them.

So perhaps a better answer for the curious child is "it's a mystery -- how would you figure it out?"

Actually *understading* how a rainbow works feels amazing. Discovering that you can split white light into an array of colors is surprising, and it's awe-inspiring. It explains a dozen other phenomena, like your red shirt looking black under blue light, and leads to a hundred new questions. It's a window to the workings of the universe. And most importantly, it doesn't go away when you grow up.

Leprechauns and fairies, unfortunately, were not so lucky.

Just because something is understood by someone else doesn't mean it's understood by you. Imagine the great scientists of old stumbling across phenomena they did not understand. Imagine Newton struggling to comprehend prisms. Imagine scientists of yore looking at phenomena that *nobody understood* and trying to figure them out.

There was a long period of time where humanity didn't know how the stars burned. Imagine being the first one to figure it out.

Imagine the euphoria of cracking a mystery

Imagine the moment of triumph he had when the first human being discovered that white light is made of colors. Imagine the euphoria of cracking a mystery.

*That euphoria can be yours*. Those mysteries have been solved by humans, *but they haven't been solved by you*. The fact that they *can* be known does not mean that you know them.

Imagine staring up at those bright points in the sky for the very first time after you've figured out that they're not just pinpricks in the veil of the heavens, but *other suns*. This mystery was perhaps spoiled for you from an early age: but I assure you, many others remain.

There are many things out there in the universe that are still mysteries to you, and every one of them is little a bit of magic waiting to be explored. @post[Reality is not mundane]reality/mere, and @post[understanding reality doesn't make it worse].

Dissolving mysteries and understanding reality is your own private road to magic.
