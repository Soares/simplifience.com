title: Your Magic

If you don't know how something works, then it works by magic.

How does a light bulb work?

How does a car work?

How does a plane work?

How does a computer work?

Don't give me vague, hand-wavy answers. I'm not wondering if you've @post[memorized the passwords]reality/passwords. I'm wondering if you actually *know* how these things work.

If you were sent back in time, would you be able to recreate these things? If the world ended tomorrow and all human information was erased, would you be able to rebuild them? The answers are out there in the environment, but are they reflected in your mind?

If I erased the answers and the vocabulary words that you use to describe carburetors and transistors and filaments, would the concepts remain? If you lost these ideas, could you reconstruct them?

If not, then it works by magic.

Magic is what powers mysterious things. But @post[mystery is not in the world]reality/mystery: mystery is in *you*. It doesn't matter if somebody else knows how cars work. So long as *you* don't know how cars work, it's magic *to you*.

@post[Magic exists]reality/magic. Humans can do incredible things, and you can't begin to fathom how. I don't care if you're a professional scientist: humans are too good at too many things. No one understands them all.

The parts you don't understand are magic.

It's a bit hard to see sometimes, in this modern world, how magical things are. Most of the obvious mysteries have already been solved. When your daughters asks what a rainbow is, the answer "light diffracting through rain" sounds a lot less exciting than "a fairy road to leprechaun gold".

It's easy to @post[repeat the words]reality/passwords "diffraction through rain drops". You can form the sounds even if you don't know what they mean, and the syllables sound so cold and dry. They don't *sound* colorful. It's harder to understand them.

So perhaps a better answer is "it's a mystery -- what do you think a rainbow is?"

Actually *understanding* how a rainbow works feels amazing. Discovering that you can split white light into an array of colors is surprising, if you haven't had the surprise spoiled, and it's awe-inspiring. It explains a dozen other phenomena, like your red shirt looking black under blue light, and leads to a hundred new questions. It's a window to the workings of the universe. And most importantly, it doesn't go away when you grow up.

@post[Leprechauns and fairies, unfortunately, were not so lucky]reality/strip.

Our great mysteries don't *feel* like mysteries. When we see a florescent light bulb, it does not feel like a burning question until we discover how it works. It feels like Just Another Real Thing. Even if we don't know the answer, we know that somebody else does. We know that we *could* find the answer, with ten minutes on the internet.

And so we don't.

Somehow, knowing that someone else has solved the mystery is all it takes for us to lose interest.

But that's not how it should be. Just because something is understood by someone else doesn't mean it's understood by you.

Imagine the great scientists of old stumbling across phenomena they did not understand. Imagine Newton struggling to comprehend prisms. Imagine scientists of yore looking at up at the stars and trying to discover what they were. They didn't know what they didn't know yet. No path was clear before them. Everybody said that things were the way they were because that's just the way they were, and the scientists didn't even know if they *could* understand the stars. They didn't even know if the answers were in their grasp.

Imagine the euphoria of cracking a mystery.

Imagine looking up to the stars and realizing for the first time what they truly are.

*That euphoria can be yours*. Those mysteries have been solved by humans, *but they haven't been solved by you*. The fact that they *can* be known does not mean that you know them.

I don't know if you've ever felt that awe. Perhaps you learned the nature of the stars so young that you don't remember the surprise. Maybe, to you, that's just the way things have always been. That mystery may have been spoiled for you.

But I assure you: many other mysteries remain.

There are many things out there in the universe that are still mysterious to you, and every one of them is little a bit of magic waiting to be explored. @post[Reality is not mundane]reality/mere, and @post[understanding reality doesn't make it worse]reality/beauty.

Dissolving mysteries and understanding reality is your own private road to magic.
