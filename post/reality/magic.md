title: Your Magic
stub: "If you don't know how it works, it works by magic. It doesn't matter if somebody else knows how a light bulb works. If *you* don't know, it's magic to you. The fact that it can be known does not make it mundane. In books and stories, there are wizards who understand the workings of magic: that does not make it less magical. If you lived in a world where wizards made lights and you didn't quite know how, it would be magic. You *do* live in that world: the fact that we name things differently doesn't take away from their power. Everything that you don't understand is magic."
