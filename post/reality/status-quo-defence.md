title: In defence of the status quo
stub: |
  People will go out of their way to defend the status quo. If you point out that lying about Santa Claus makes no sense, everyone will immediately jump to St. Nick's defence arguing that the myth helps instill a bit of magic and wonder into the lives of children, that Santa Claus helps bring happiness at a dark time of year. They don't stop to think that there are better ways to instill magic. There are better ways to bring hapiness. There are better ways to brighten the lives of children. They aren't arguing in favor of imparting wonder onto children, they're arguing in favor of preserving the status quo.
