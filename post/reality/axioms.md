$2 + 2 = 4$.

That's another way of saying that $&bull;&bull;$ near $&bull;&bull;$ is $&bull;&bull;&bull;&bull;$, no matter what $&bull;$ is standing in for. This seems almost trivially obvious.

But it's not always true. If you have two apples in a bowl, and then you go out and pick two more apples and put them in your bowl, you don't always have four apples in the bowl.

Sometimes a kid will have eaten an apple while you were gone, and you'll only have three apples. Sometimes your friend picked one too, and you'll have five. Sometimes it takes you a hundred years to pick the apples, and when you get back, your original apples have rotted away. Sometimes they've grown into trees, and now you have a hundred apples.

In these cases we don't say that $2 + 2 \ne 4$. We say that *the apples weren't acting like numbers*. In order for the rules of numbers to apply, your apples can't disappear into the mouths of children or appear in the hands of your friend. If they do, they aren't acting like numbers. Numbers can't be eaten. Numbers can't rot away. Numbers can't sprout trees.

There are *very specific rules* that specify when numbers apply. Numbers apply when things aren't merging or growing or rotting or being eaten. When you say

> $2 + 2 = 3$, because this kid ate one of my apples!

We reply

> Wrong. $2 + 2 = 4$. Addition doesn't apply to things that are being eaten.

These special rules are rules that you have to satisfy yourself before you can even use the model. They're not laws of the system -- they're barriers to entry.

We call these <span class="define" markdown="inline">axioms</span>. Axioms don't have to be true, but *when they are* true, the rules of the system apply.

<aside class="define" markdown="block">
__Axiom__ *n.*
A statement from which other proofs flow. When the axioms are true the rules of the system apply.
</aside>

Whenever the axioms of addition apply, $2 + 2$ is *always* $4$. If you find a real-world scenario where $2 + 2 \ne 4$ that's not because addition is wrong, it's because the axioms don't apply in your situation.

In this way, statements about addition are *always* true. $2 + 2 = 4$ is a *true statement*. If you find a violation, it's your fault, not addition's fault.

$2 + 2 = 4$ is a true statement, but it's not necessarily helpful. This is also a true statement:

> If all elephants are purple, and all purple elephants have penguin riders, then all elephants have penguin riders.

Here the axioms are

* All elephants are purple
* All purple elephants have penguin riders

and the statement is

* All elephants have penguin riders

*Given* the axioms, this statement is true. *If* you believe the axioms, the statement follows. Hopefully you don't believe the axioms.

Just because something is *true* doesn't mean it is *useful*. We can easily prove that *if* the axioms of addition apply to reality *then* two real things plus two real things is four real things. The hard part is proving that reality follows the axioms of addition.

It seems intuitive to us that apples follow the rules, and thus we feel like we can take the deductions of addition and apply them to apples. But our intuition has been wrong before. How do you know that apples *actually* act like numbers?

Two apples plus two apples is four apples. You can go test that if you don't believe me. But what about $179,482,000$ apples plus $3$ apples?

You've been taught since childhood that this yields $179,482,003$ apples. But are you sure? You haven't tried it. You haven't put a hundred and seventy nine hundred thousand, four hundred and eighty two thousand apples in one place, added three more apples, and then counted them up. You've never seen it done. You're just blindly trusting that apples work like numbers and then manipulating the numbers.

> What if real things don't actually follow the addition axioms?

What if in the *real* world, $179,482,000$ apples added to $3$ apples is actually $179,482,009$ apples? What if apples don't *quite* follow the axioms of addition? What if there's some tiny subtlety where our axioms aren't consistent with reality, a tiny difference that we don't notice for small numbers but which shows up when you try to add big amounts of real things?

Stranger things have happened. Solid laws of physics have been shattered upon the discovery that reality doesn't *completely* obey the axioms.

With formal notation and rational thought we can prove how things work *given* a set of axioms, but this only matters if reality honors them.

I wouldn't worry too much about numbers. The axioms of numbers are pretty simple, and we're <span class="info" markdown="inline">quite sure</span> that they describe reality.

<aside class="info" markdown="block">
Also, we've tried out lots of big numbers. Many physical systems depend upon reality following the rules of numbers. Trusting addition is a safe bet.
</aside>

While reality does seem to obey the axioms of addition, reality has often @post[violated]math/explore axioms that we thought were trivial.

What are we to do? We can prove things *given axioms*, but we can @post[never be certain]reality/certainty that reality actually follows those axioms. Fortunately, all is not lost. Even  when reality doesn't *completely* obey our axioms, our axioms are not useless.

Our models are useful even when they aren't perfect. If you try to add a trillion apples to a trillion apples, you won't end up with two trillion apples. You'll end up with a tiny planet made from the crushed remains of two trillion apples. Addition doesn't apply to apples in the long term, because apples don't follow all the axioms.

But we don't need an "if" for the model to work. We need a "when".

*When* apples follow the axioms of addition -- when you kid isn't eating them, and you friend isn't picking more, and they aren't crushing themselves into a tiny planet -- *then* the discoveries of addition apply to apples.

We can never prove that reality always follows our axioms. But *when it does*, the models that flow from our axioms are like windows into the workings of the world.
