Reality is not mysterious.

Reality just *is*.

There is no such thing as a mysterious rock. A rock can't be inherently mysterious. A rock can be mysterious *to you*, but it cannot be inherently mysterious.

Perhaps the rock is glowing green, and you don't know why. It's a mystery to you: until you discover that someone painted it with glow-in-the-dark paint. Then it's not mysterious any more.

In fact, the rock was never mysterious in the first place. It was only ever a painted rock. The mystery was in you.

The map is not the territory! The fact that a rock is mysterious in your map of reality doesn't make it mysterious in actual reality. In fact, mystery is just a statement of your lack of knowledge. @post[Anything ordered has structure]reality/order -- mystery is what it feels like to be ignorant of the structure.

Ignorance of structure does not make structure disappear.

Mysteries are not sacred. They are not part of reality. They are a part of your mind.

Mysteries are not to be worshiped -- to worship a mystery is to worship your own ignorance.

No, mysteries are a challenge. They're a nut to crack. They're a problem to solve. They're a question to be answered. They're @post[your own little road to your own personal magic]reality/magical.

If you find a mystery, don't throw up your hands and @post[declare it unsolvable]science/purview. That would only deprive you of the fun. Instead, reconstruct the mystery. Discover how it works.

Mysteries are invitations to learn something new about this wonderful place in which we live. Don't squander them.
