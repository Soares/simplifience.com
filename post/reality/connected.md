title: Everything is connected
stub: Everything is connected more tightly than we think. It feels like you can imagine a world where a gas exerts more pressure on the compartment as it gets colder. It feels like you can imagine a world where momentum can be destroyed but nothing else changes. It feels like you can imagine a world where you can break light speed but not travel back in time. This is because our words are less connected than the things they describe.
