@post[The allegory of the axe]allegory/axe follows an alien who's view of reality is limited to a radar screen. When the alien looks at your [grandfather's axe](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship_of_Theseus), the alien sees only labeled blips.

<div class="axe"></div>

From the perspective of the alien, the blue dot looks separable from the red dots. The alien believes that the blue dot can be removed from the rest, for it can surely imagine such a world. It would look like this:

<div class="axe" data-axe="[-3, -1]" data-center="[0.5, 2]" data-angle="0.24"></div>

And, indeed, the radar screen seems perfectly capable of displaying such a thing. Why *shouldn't* the blue dot be separable from the reds? Why should reality deign to care?

And yet, try as the alien might, the alien cannot separate the axe from its handle and its blade. No matter how clever the alien's devices, the blue dot rests firmly between the reds -- reality conspires to thwart our hero.

Of course, the alien is mistaken. Reality is not thwarting our alien protagonist. There is no axiom in the foundations of reality which states "an axe may not be removed from its handle and its blade". No, the problem is with the alien's labels.

The problem is that the alien's labels are *overquantified*. The alien's labels are separated in a way that reality is not. The labels have more degrees of freedom than the things they're attached to.

Imagine the alien's protests:

<div class="define" markdown="block">
You say the blue dot has more freedom on the radar than it does in reality. But then *what rule of reality* is restricting its freedom?
</div>

There is no rule restricting the axe's freedom. The alien fails to grasp that the axe *is* the handle and the blade. The alien has too many labels -- it's failing to keep the object separate from its constituent parts. It's labels are interwoven *in reality*, even though they look disjoint on the radar screen.

<div class="define" markdown="block">
It's a simple question -- can the axe be removed from the handle in the blade, and if not, why not?
</div>

No. Of course not. Such a thing is impossible.

Such a thing is *less* than impossible. Humans have been doing the impossible for centuries. I do three impossible things before breakfast. But no matter what technological advances the world sees or how the foundations of physics shake, you'll still never separate an axe from its handle and its blade.

The word "impossible" implies that a thing is conceivably possible in the first place. The alien's goal isn't impossible: it's simply incoherent. It's disjoint. The labels don't match reality. It's overquantified. The alien has too many labels and not enough connections between them.

You may shake your head and laugh at the alien, but you are not so different. Humans are quick to stick @post[contrived]intro/contrives labels on things that they do not understand, and our words are often @post[too powerful]language/scope for what they mean to say. It's easy to recognize the alien's mistake in a world where you get to actually see an axe, where you get to feel the wood and the metal in your hands. This mistake is not so easy to avoid when you step outside your @post[narrow]reality/narrow comfort zone.

Reality is tightly connected -- more tightly connected than it appears on the surface. @post[A label is not the thing it labels]reality/symbology. Our labels for the universe were invented long before we understood these connections, and the labels are a lot less tightly coupled than reality itself.

You may find it easy to imagine magnetism in the absence of electricity. You may find it easy to imagine heat in the absence of motion. You may imagine it's possible for electric devices to stop working without impacting the powers of thought. You imagine speeds faster than light speed. But remember, when you imagine these things, that the alien imagines the axe moving separately from its handle and its blade.

There are deep connections in physics that you do not know yet. This means that *you cannot trust your labels*. They are connected in ways that you do not understand, and until you learn what you do not know it is very easy for you to draw silly pictures that look perfectly fine to you.

<div class="axe" data-axe="[-3, -1]" data-center="[0.5, 2]" data-angle="0.24"></div>

There is no fundamental axiom that prevents the axe from leaving its parts. There is no mysterious force binding the axe in place between its handle and its blade. The alien just has a bad model.

Similarly, most of the restrictions in physics are not actually laws -- you just have a bad model.

Whenever reality thwarts you at every turn, do not take it as a sign that reality is conspiring against yo. Instead, take it as a hint: Your labels are disjoint. The things they label are bound together in a way that you do not understand.

Reality is connected more tightly than you know.
