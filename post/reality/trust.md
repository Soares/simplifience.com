Don't trust me.

I'd appreciate it if you invest social trust in me. I'm here with good intentions to teach you honestly about the nature of reality.

That said, I will be wrong.

I will do my best to be right, but sometimes I will be wrong.

Never trust me completely. Never trust *anyone* completely. Don't even trust your own mind completely. Be skeptical of everything. Ask why. Find your own reasoning. Keep being skeptical until you find evidence that convinces you, and don't believe *anything* until you're <span class="info" markdown="inline">satisfied</span>.

When someone tells you that a thing is true, that does not mean that the sky is blue. When I say "the sky is blue", my words do not *make* the sky blue.

If you are an underdweller who has never seen the sky, you can not treat my statement as fact. You can only treat my statement as *evidence*.

If I'm a known pathological liar, my statement is poor evidence. If I'm a close friend who's been Above, my statement is be good evidence. Either way, my words are evidence about the truth: they are not the truth itself.

This is true regardless of how confidently I talk. It doesn't matter if I say "I'm pretty sure the sky is blue" or "the sky is definitely blue" -- to you, my words are merely evidence.

Even if I am honest and sane, you should not trust my words.

Perhaps I mean well, but I misunderstood what I saw. I am fallible.

Perhaps I understood, but accidentally spoke ambiguously -- @post[language is powerful]language/scope and it is @post[difficult to be precise]language/simplicity.

Even if I am honest, and I understood correctly, and I express it reasonably, *you* may misunderstand. Minds work differently. Ideas can easily get @post[lost in translation]reality/translation.

Whenever we communicate, there are a dozen ways to transmit the wrong information. I cannot open your mind and pour my knowledge in. *Even if I could*, you should treat it with caution: my knowledge is incomplete, perhaps dangerously so.

Verify what I tell you. Question the parts that sound questionable. Convince yourself, and don't be satisfied until you do.

In the end, the only person you can trust is yourself.
