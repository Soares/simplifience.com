title: Counter your Intuition
---

You may have heard that physics is unintuitive. That things get strange once we step outside the comfort zone of humans, the thin band of reality sandwiched between extraordinarily tiny and mind-bogglingly huge.

This is only partially true. Humans are born with faulty intuitions, courtesy of the ancestral savanna where our brains were forged. But it's only *partially* true: you also have good intuitions.

The intuition that $&bull;&bull; + &bull;&bull;&bull; = &bull;&bull;&bull;&bull;&bull;$ is solid. You've got great intuition for geometry in three flat dimensions. You have many good intuitions that you can use to understand reality.

Learning happens when your intuitions come into conflict. When your intuitions clash. Bad intuitions are not a matter of opinion: bad intuitions are the ones that aren't consistent with good intuitions.

The intuitions that are built into the human brain don't all agree. If you push them outside of their comfort zone, they'll start to disagree with each other.

Learning about the universe is about finding conflicts in your intuitions. It's about identifying two things that you think are true when you *know* that only one is correct. It's about @post[asking reality]reality/truth which one is true and feeding *that* intuition while eliminating the others.

Kill your bad intuitions. For every bad intuition that dies, your good ones become stronger. Before you know it, you may actually @post[understand]reality/understanding what you set out to learn.
