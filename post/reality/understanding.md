title: Understand this

Picture someone who believes in the Norse gods.

To them, their belief does not feel like a belief. It feels like *the way the world is*.

They don't feel like they live in a world where they believe in Odin. They feel like they live in a world where *Odin is real*. They feel like they live in a world where Odin *did* hang from the world tree to gain his wisdom over the nine worlds. They feel like they live in a world where Asgard actually exists.

When you believe something, it doesn't feel like believing it. It feels like *living in that world.*

Similarly, when you truly understand something, it doesn't feel like understanding it. @post[Memorizing calculus equations is not the same thing as understanding calculus]math/education, no matter how many state exams you can pass.

When you've obtained understanding of a concept, the concept feels obvious. The answers are self evident, and you don't see how they could be another way.

$2 + 3 = 5$ not because that's what the symbols tell you when you torture them. $2 + 3 = 5$ because if you put $&bull;&bull;$ with $&bull;&bull;&bull;$ then you have $&bull;&bull;&bull;&bull;&bull;$.

When you understand something, it doesn't feel like a memorized set of symbols and formulae and equations. When you truly understand something, it feels like the gut-level intuitive truth.
