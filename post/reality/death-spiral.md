Asks the one.

It's an object for sitting on.

Replies the other.

The other opens their mouth to answer, and the philosophical death spiral begins.

You've probably seen this happen before. There is no end to this line of questioning: it grows ever more abstract, and cannot satisfactorily terminate. If you want to explain what a concept is, you cannot explain it by invoking abstract concepts. Or, rather, you can sometimes, among knowledgeable people who know the language. But among children and pedants you'll be forced to abstract further, and generalize further, until you're trying to explain the very concept of "things".

No, if you want to actually explain a real concept, the way to do it is to *point to reality*.

What is a chair? These are chairs:

Rather, those are images of chairs. If we were in person, I would point out a chair for you. Here's another picture of a chair:

Do you start to see what chairs are?

Chairs are not an exact cluster of objects. There are objects that straddle the line between chair and stool, or chair and tree-stump, or chair and rotted wooden wreckage. But you are not the chair-arbiter, and @post[the edges of the group are not important]language/edges. If someone asks what a chair is, they don't need detailed rules for how to distinguish between a chair, a broken chair, and scrap wood. They need you to direct them towards the [cluster of things](http://lesswrong.com/lw/nl/the_cluster_structure_of_thingspace/) to which you attach the "chair" label.

If you can only describe a word in terms of other words, then that's a good sign that either you don't quite understand the word, or the word isn't connected to reality. Show, don't tell. Give examples. *Point me towards* the cluster of things that fall under your label. Use descriptions to help me narrow down the cluster if I become confused. But as a rule of thumb, show first and tell later.

If you can't show, brace yourself: you might be diving into a philosophical death spiral.
