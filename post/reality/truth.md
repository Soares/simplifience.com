title: Truth
stub: |
  There is a such thing as truth, even if you prefer to use a different word. Despite the fact that humans cannot possess certainty, reality can enforce certain things. We call that which reality enforces "truth".

A question asked far too often. This question is what you get when you combine the TODO: [impossibility of certainty](prove-it) with a TODO: [philosophical death spiral](death-spiral).

It is certain that <span class="info">you can never be certain of anything</span>. That does not mean that there's no such thing as "truth".

Probably.

Truth exists. We can argue over the word itself all you want, but @post[the symbol is not the symbolized]reality/symbology. And at the end of the day, no matter what you call it or how much you [insist otherwise](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trivialism), [there is something that acts like truth](http://lesswrong.com/lw/eqn/the_useful_idea_of_truth/).

No matter how hard you believe you will fly if you jump naked off of a cliff, you won't. There is [something out there](http://yudkowsky.net/rational/the-simple-truth) that distinguishes between what you believe is true and what actually is true in reality.

You may label this property of the real with whatever word you like. I, for one, will be calling it <span class="define">truth</span>.

**Truth** *n.* Whatever reality enforces.
