$2 + 2 = 4$. This is true. But then again, so is this:

> If all elephants are purple and all purple elephants have penguin riders, then all elephants have penguin riders.

One of these truths seems a bit more useful than the other.

Truth is just @post[that which reality enforces]reality/truth. How, then, do we conclude that the above statement is true? There are few purple elephants to check.

Logical truths are not necessarily truths that may be found in reality. Rather, logical truths are truths that must be enforced by *every reality*.
