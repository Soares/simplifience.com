title: Validity
stub: We have called truth @post[only that which reality enforces]reality/truth. But there seems to be another type of truth, as well. Logical statements can be valid even when they do not pertain to reality. That is a different matter alltogether.

$2 + 2 = 4$. This is true. But then again, so is this:

> IF all elephants are purple AND all purple elephants have penguin riders, THEN all elephants have penguin riders.

One of these truths seems a bit more useful than the other.

Unfortunately, the word 'truth' is a bit @post[contrived]intro/contrives. Truth is not only @post[that which reality enforces]reality/truth. We also use the word 'truth' to mean "that which is logically valid".

Logically valid things are a completely different can of worms. Logic isn't about finding the truth: indeed, the above statement concerning elephants is logically sound, and yet very few elephants have penguin riders.

No, logic is about *preserving* truth. *If* you start with true premises then logic gives you true results.

This is very important. Logic is a set of known operations we can do that *preserve the truth*. That means that any time we find a truth in the wild we can apply logic to the truth and trust the things that logic tells us. That's what logic is all about.

Logic is a different beast entirely from truth. Perhaps one day simplifience will have do a sequence on logic. For now, your gut intuition should be enough, so long as you remeber this:

> Logic doesn't create truth. Logic preserves truth.
