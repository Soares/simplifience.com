This is not a pipe.

![Not a pipe](/images/not-a-pipe.jpg){:title="R. Magritte - Ceci n'est pas une pipe."}

This is an image of a pipe. Similarly, this is not the number one:

$1$
{:.number}

This is a *symbol* which evokes the <span class="info">number one</span> in your mind.

@post[Which one]number/schism does it invoke for you?
</aside>

Similarly, these scribbles on the screen that you are reading are not words. The *true* words are a sentiment being passed between you and I. They are qualia, something which these squiggles strive for and fail to fully capture.

It is <span class="info">easy to forget</span> this distinction. It is easy to say "zero is nothing" rather than "zero means nothing". Blurring this line is a road filled with [land mines](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trivialism). Do not mix up the word "truth" with @post[that which it symbolizes]reality/truth.

Surely an error in how our minds work.

[Vi Hart](http://vihart.com/) does a tremendous job explaining this in the midst of a fun video about cutting spacetime:

There are two ways that this knowledge should make you very, very cautious.

1. Be wary of your symbols. It is possible (in fact, almost certain) that some symbols which you hold dear are @post[housing multiple meanings]number/schism. Don't be fooled into thinking that all things represented by the same symbol must be the same thing! When your symbols don't quite correspond to that which you're trying to describe it is very easy to get confused. Try to look past the symbol itself and see that which it symbolizes.
2. The letters and symbols which we use to convey *true* ideas, *real* words: these are imperfect. The same word may evoke something entirely different in the two of us. Don't fall into the trap of thinking that because you're saying the same words or reading the same page you must both be thinking the same thing! Humans tend to think that everyone thinks like they do, but that is [usually not the case](http://lesswrong.com/lw/dr/generalizing_from_one_example/). Words and numbers are, at their core, imperfect.

I leave you with some wise words from a man who proved himself very good at both learning and teaching:

If you want to better understand the distinction between symbols and symbolized and where the lines begin to blur, I recommend [GÃ¶del, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid](https://www.google.com/search?q=godel+escher+bach+an+eternal+golden+braid&tbm=shop).
