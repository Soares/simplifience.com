Welcome to reality!

Take a look around. Gaze up at the stars. Find a rainbow, if you can. This place is pretty nice, don't you think? I mean, it has it's ups and downs, but in the end, it's all there is. This place, reality, contains everything. It contains the ground and the stars and you, and it contains your emotions and your connections and your feelings. Reality is all that is.

This sequence is going to get a little meta. It's going to talk about how reality is an @post[ordered place]reality/order that @post[has rules]reality/rules. It's going to talk about how everything in the universe can be understood -- even the things that you might think are sacred, like your consciousness. Don't worry! @post[Understanding does not detract from beauty]reality/beauty. Take a deep breath. Feel like you're alive. That feeling is real, and no argument can make it less so.

This sequence is about learning that reality does have rules that humans can understand, and ensuring that you're ready to enjoy it. It's popular today to feel existential crisis because "nothing has meaning" -- for doesn't science say that everything is merely made of smaller parts?

If everything is just made of atoms, and atoms can't feel, then is there any point to feeling?

The answer, of course, is an emphatic *yes*. The universe is made of smaller parts, but @post[it is not mere]reality/mere.

This sequence isn't essential to understanding the nature of the universe, but it might help prevent an existential crisis. Yes, we're going to describe existence with equations -- but that's not a loss. It's a victory.
