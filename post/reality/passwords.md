title: Passwords
stub: If I say "why do objects fall", you might shout "gravity!". Then we both go our separate ways, and you feel like you knew the answer. But did you really know the answer? Do you really know why objects fall? If you were sent back in time to ancient greece, long before the term "gravity" had any meaning, could you explain it to them? Knowing the right words isn't the same as knowing the knowledge. You only know something when I can erase the words and you re-invent the thing. Otherwise you're just reciting passwords.
