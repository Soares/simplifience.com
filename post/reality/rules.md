title: The Rules
---
The universe follows rules.

If you know precisely where the billiard balls are and exactly how the cue ball is struck, you can figure out exactly how they move.

If you know exactly how the deck is stacked then you know exactly which cards are going to come up.

The rules of the universe seem static. You expect tomorrow to be very similar to today. Even if tomorrow is wildly different by your human standards, you still expect to find the earth solid beneath your feet. You expect to find the molecules of your body still bound together in the usual fashion. You expect the sun to still be shining. You expect the laws of physics to remain unchanged. You expect two plus two to continue equalling four.

The universe has static rules, and *knowing the rules gives you power*. At some base level, your brain understands the rules of billiard balls. It is that power that allows you to guide the game of pool in your favor (however imperfectly). Understanding the rules of air allows you to build airplanes. Understanding the rules of electricity allows you to build computers.

Understanding the rules of speech (well enough to communicate) allows you to convey and learn ideas.

"But wait", you say. "Reality is a large and complicated place. We can't possibly understand it all. If we can't understand reality, how could we possibly understand the rules which govern it?"

This is a valid complaint. You can create systems where the rules are more complicated than the output.

Fortunately for us, the rules of reality seem to be simple.

Earth's atmosphere is an incredibly complex place, with billions of teeny tiny molecules bouncing into each other aggregating into complex wind patterns and unpredictable hurricanes. Predicting the weather is incredibly difficult if not impossible. Nevertheless, we can still learn the rules of the teeny tiny molecules.

The effects of the rules are extremely complicated. The rules of reality give rise to stars, planets, hurricanes, and humans. The rules of reality give rise to *thought*. The things that the rules produce are extraordinary, complex, and beautiful. But the *rules themselves* are simple.

Or, at least, the ones we've discovered so far have happened to be simple. We haven't figured out all the rules yet.

It's possible that we *can't* figure out how reality really works. It's possible that the rules are far too complicated. It's possible that the human brain just isn't powerful enough to understand what's going on.

But that's not what it looks like from here.

What it looks like from here is every complex, complicated, beautiful creation of reality -- from rainbows to flower petals to the thoughts in your head -- arises from a much simpler set of rules. From the ground it looks like learning the rules can help us make telescopes and figure out where we came from.

From our vantage point on Earth, it looks like the beautiful complexity we see around us is the result of a ridiculous amount of energy following some ridiculously simple rules.

This is humbling. Reality didn't have to be like this. We can imagine universes where the rules aren't simple.

But *ours are simple*. The rules that we've found so far have been simpler than the complexities they allow. Our universe is a place that lends itself well to understanding.

So let's go out there and understand it.
