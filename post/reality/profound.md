This sounds profound.

Speaking of sounds, imagine a tree falling in the forest with no one there to hear. Does it make a sound?

The one says "Of course! The air still ripples!"

The other says "Of course not! Sound is perception, and there is no one there to hear it!"

[This, too, sounds profound](http://lesswrong.com/lw/np/disputing_definitions/).

The human mind is very good at making meaningless and useless statements sound profound.

[You can imagine things that are not possible]({ "It's just your imagination" | page }). The human mind has an extraordinary ability to take a sentence and see meaning. This powerful tool can sometimes backfire, and you must be wary of such events.

> This sentence is false.

Just because a sentence looks useful, and because you understand the words, does not mean that a sentence is meaningful. The content of the above sentence tells you very little about its truth or falsehood. It puts you in a frame of mind where you believe that each sentence must have a truth value: this is false. ("Do you want to go to the movies with me?" is neither true nor false.) But because the sentence puts on airs, the human mind loves to generate [endless reasoning](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liar_paradox) about the truth or falsehood of a sentence that has absolutely nothing to do with reality.

You ask whether "This sentence is false" is true. I ask why you think it should have a truth value. What in reality does it describe? What does it mean if it is true, instead of false? And why do you think that the [useful idea of truth]({"Truth" | page}) applies to that sentence?

It is very easy for a sentence to sound profound, to trick you into wondering whether it is right or wrong when perhaps it is merely invalid.

<aside class="info" markdown="block">
'110%' is like 'falursh'. All the symbols make sense individually, but together they don't say anything of import.

It is easy to set your brain off imagining things that are logically invalid.

It feels like you can imagine a world where true is the same as false, or one is the same as two. I simply say "imagine a world where one equals two", and a zany image floats across your mind. *Imagining something is not <span class="info">evidence</span> that it can exist,* nor even that it makes sense.

<aside class="info" markdown="block">
It is merely evidence that you can imagine it.

The symbols that we use, the languages that we use, are often poor at describing actual reality. It is sometimes interesting to take a look at the corner cases, at the words and phrases we can say that don't actually correspond to anything real. The places where the symbols linger longer than their original intended use.

These places where symbols exceed their use may sound like deep, unanswerable questions. Don't be fooled. What you're looking at is not some deeply profound question: it's the shortcomings of your tools.
