title: Paradox

> This sentence is false.

Is the above sentence true? If it's true it's false. If it's false it's true. This seems like a paradox. Truth, apparently, is @post[not so simple]reality/truth. Or is it? Perhaps this sentence will help demystify the paradox:

> Let's go get some pizza.

Is the above sentence true or false?

The above sentence is a sentence.

Sentences don't need to be true or false. Remember the [parable of the dagger](http://lesswrong.com/lw/ne/the_parable_of_the_dagger/). Remember to @post[separate the symbols from the meaning]reality/symbology. Sentences don't *need* to be true or false. They can just be.

The paradoxical sentence tricks you into thinking it should be true or false. It *asks* to be true or false. When you're asked a question, it feels like you have to answer it. It's easy to forget that the sentence is just symbols. It doesn't need any more truth or falsehood than "Let's go get some pizza".

Truth is merely @post[that which reality enforces]reality/truth. Until you can point to a situation in reality which actually acts like that sentence, the paradox is not real.

Be careful not to confuse up truth with @post[validity]reality/validity. Any system of logic powerful enough to self-reference can create paradoxical statements whose validity is impossible to verify. A paradox feels uncomfortable because it's hard to assess it's *validity* -- but this is an artifact of your logical system, not an artifact of reality. Undefinable validity is a real problem for logicians, but they are not a violation of truth.

Truth is what happens when reality gets a say. Valid logic doesn't turn into truth until you find a part of reality where the logical axioms apply. Paradoxes are real roadblocks for logicians, but humans have never encountered a real paradox.

"This sentence is false" is not a paradox. It's the *description* of a paradox in a self-referential language. Unless you can point to an actual paradox happening in the real world, logical paradoxes do not impinge upon the truth.
