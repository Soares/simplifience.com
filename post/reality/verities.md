Reality has rules to it.

No, that's not right. Rules were made to be broken.

Reality has *laws* to it --

Except that's not right either. Laws are just graduated rules. They may have harsher consequences, but they can be broken just as easily.

Reality seems to have something *deeper* than rules or laws.

Of course, reality does have a whole bunch of rules and laws. "Trees grow up" -- that's a rule, but it has exceptions. Some trees grow sideways. Maybe "trees grow towards sunlight" is a better rule -- or it was, until we grew trees in artificial greenhouses. "Trees grow towards the light"? Perhaps they do when left alone, but not when we [shape them](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_shaping).

"Water is incompressible" -- this is a great rule for engineers, and it's false in extreme circumstances.

Newton's law of universal gravitation certainly seemed pretty solid, until we found exceptions.

Are reality's rules just like our own? Are they full of exceptions and special cases? Or are there really deeper rules, rules that can't be broken?

@post[It doesn't look like it]reality/simple.

Every time we've dug deeper in reality we've found better rules. Every time we discovered an exception in a seemingly universal law, we uncovered an even *deeper* law which looks even *more* universal.

Every time we find violations in the laws of physics, it @post[shatters our worldview]math/explore, unifies things we thought un-unifiable, and humbles us with the simplicity of the universe.

And then those *new* laws look like they've never been violated.

Not once.

Not once in the entire history of time.

These underlying rules are hardly laws -- perhaps we should call them <span class="info" markdown="inline">verities</span> instead. These verities are the source of all other imperfect laws. They are the rules that govern @post[this ordered universe]reality/order.

__Verity__ *n.* A fundamental truth from which all truths flow. An axiom of reality.
</aside>

Unfortunately, we can never find them.

A verity is a true rule of reality, one which can never be violated -- and humans are notoriously bad at finding them. More than once, we've thought we had a verity only to watch it slip through our fingers. Even now, the physics that we hold to be fundamental is likely derived from deeper laws. Are *any* of the laws we know actually axioms of the real?

We cannot know.

The only way to know that something is not violate throughout all time is to watch for all time -- and even then, it is hard to show that a rule could not *in principle* be violated. Perhaps one day we will uncover the simple rules from which all else springs. Perhaps, if we're lucky, it will be come clear to us why those rules are, and no other rules can be. One day, perhaps we will find a way to truly dissolve a "why".

That day, if it comes, is a long way off.

Until then, we can only seek the verities. We can never catch them.

It turns out our universe is poetic.
