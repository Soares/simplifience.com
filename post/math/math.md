Mathematics is <span class="info" markdown="inline">many things</span> to many people. It has no single definition. For that reason, we will avoid the term.

<aside class="info" markdown="block">
Some people find it intimidating. This implies misunderstading of the true nature of mathematics.
</aside>

Instead of discussing "Mathematics" we'll break the term down into two primary components. First and foremost,

> Mathematics is the description of anything that works.

Take anything with patterns, anything with order, or anything with underlying structure. Figure out how it works. That's mathematics.

@post[Fortunately for us]reality/totally-unpredictable, existence follows rules. There are properties of reality that are the same no matter where you're standing, no matter which way you're looking, and no matter what time it is.

When we <span class="info" markdown="inline">write these things down</span>, when we tear aside the curtains and look at what actually makes reality tick: that's mathematics.

You need not use the <span class="info" markdown="inline">strange notation</span> passed down through the millennia. @post[These symbols are not mathematics]reality/symbology! They are merely one notation for mathematics -- an @post[old and obtuse]math/archaic notation at that. We can do better. That's why we're here.

<aside class="info" markdown="block">
Like $\Sigma$, $\Pi$, $\sqrt{}$ and $i$.

*Any* unambiguous description of governing rules is mathematics.

Learning the rules gives us @post[super powers]math/super-powers. If we wish to understand reality, we must first describe it.

You may have heard that the rules of the universe are written in mathematics. It is not so much that the rules of the universe are written in math -- it's that whenever we write them down they *become* math by definition.

Because *math is the rules*. It's any description of anything that works.

Of course, math is also more than that. Mathematics is also about *exploring* the rules. The rules can @post[tell you many things]math/listen. Here at simplifience we focus on reality: we won't be exploring the rules for the rules' sake.

But though we will not partake here, know that @post[exploring the rules]math/beauty is a beautiful, humbling, and rewarding experience.
