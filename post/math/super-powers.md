title: Learn the Rules
stub: |
  Humans have conquered the earth by learning the rules of reality and using them to their advantage.
  Should probably be moved to the 'rules' sequence, perhaps the 'reality' sequence.

Why learn how the universe works?

Well, native curiosity, for one thing. You know how kids can't stop asking why?
You used to be a kid once. What happened to that feeling? I bet it's still
somewhere deep inside of you, if you dig far enough.

*Why* are we here? What's up with this whole <span>existence</span>{:.info}
thing, anyway?

<aside class="info">
And don't say 'religion'. Until we have proof, I'm not going to stop
looking for the real answers. They'll probably surprise us.
</aside>

If that's not enough reason to motivate you, consider what knowledge of the
universe has given us so far. We can fly around the entire planet in a single
day and with minimal effort. We can contact friends halfway around the world in
the space of a thought. We can convene a symphony in our ears on demand and live
long lives without fear of disease.

We've literally discovered magic. Ask anyone from two millennia ago: we are
wizards. Only, it's not magic to us. Why not?

> Because we understand it.

And the universe only gets more interesting. Did you know that you can time
travel <span>to the future</span>{:.rigor}? That you can fly to the center of
the galaxy in half a second, even though it's 27,000 light years away? That
gravity isn't a force?

<aside class="rigor">
Faster than usual, I mean. It's fairly easy to travel to the future at the
normal rate of one second per earth second.
</aside>

We don't understand the universe yet, not deeply, but we understand *far* more
than most people think. Misconceptions abound. People are still confused about
very well-established facts, thinking that they're still the <span>sticking
points</span>{:.science} of modern physics. Most people don't even *know* the
open questions that humanity faces down every day.

<aside>Entanglement and uncertainty, for instance. Don't worry, they'll be
intuitive by the time we're through.</aside>{:.science}

It doesn't help that these incredibly cool revelations are hidden behind opaque
walls of confusing scientific history and literal millennia of scientific cruft.

That's no way to make new discoveries.

We can see far because we stand upon the shoulders of giants.

Imagine how far we could see if the giants were not so stooped?
