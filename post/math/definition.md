I don't know what "Mathematics" is.

What I do know is that it's trying to mean too many things. It is a loaded term. As far as I can tell, the word "Mathematics" hides at least three distinct meanings.

Many claim to hate mathematics. Such people know only the first face of mathematics, the @post[strange and confusing]math/archaic symbols and notation. These people think that the language of math *is* math, and they're not wrong: the word "math" encompasses both the language and <span class="info" markdown="inline">what the language says</span>.

</aside>

Others see past this superficial face. They look beyond the notation. These people realize that math is just another word for the @post[power of rules]reality/rules. They realize that beauty is patterns. They feel the beauty in symmetry. They see the mathematics in fractals and flowers and sunsets, and they cannot understand how any could hate mathematics.

Still others don't stop at discovering the rules. They @post[explore]math/explore the rules and their implications. They @post[discover the true nature]math/listen of reality. They know the toils of formalism better than most, and though they understand its boundless beauty of mathematics they also understand why math is not for everyone. For them, math is the rigorous yet rewarding exploration of logical depths. Nothing is more difficult, and yet nothing is more rewarding.

The word "mathematics" is trying to mean too many things:

1. A stale language for writing down rules.
2. The formalization of any set of rules.
3. The exploration of said rules.

The term "mathematics" is exactly the sort of thing that simplifience discards. Here we @post[distinguish between]math/shatter rules, the language for rules, and the exploration of rules.

Simplifience is here to discover the rules of reality. It will do so on its own terms, in <span class="info" markdown="inline">its own language</span>.

A language similar but not beholden to modern mathematics.

Exploring the rules is a beautiful and fulfilling endeavor that simplifience will not pursue. Here we are concerned with learning the rules of reality that humanity has already discovered.

Despite the fact that simplifience will not partake, exploring the unplumbed corners of reality is a difficult and <span class="info" markdown="inline">supremely rewarding</span> endeavor.

Despite this, simplifience will be leaving the term "Mathematics" behind.
