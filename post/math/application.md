  Math applies to everything. (Not the lanugage part, but the rules part). Must be broken up now that the term 'mathematics' is tabood.

This is a question commonly asked by students in math courses who are sick of memorizing boring made-up rules that teachers insist are important.

No particular set of rules is guaranteed to be useful in your day-to-day life. Depending upon what you plan to do with your life, you'll need to learn some rules very well and you're welcome to ignore the rest.

That said, you'll *always* be using mathematics. Math isn't just churning numbers or calculating derivatives -- that's boring. A computer can do that. Math is @post[discovering the rules]math/math and @post[exploring them]math/listen.

@post[Math is not math symbols]reality/symbology! Math is *any set of <span class="info" markdown="inline">patterns or rules</span>*.

It's math whether or not you decide to write it down using "mathy" symbols.

If you know how a car motor works so well that you're able to hear a specific rattle and immediately know what's wrong with the car, that's mathematics. Whether you write it down or not, you understand the pattern and extrapolate results.

The workings of a motor is mathematics. Understanding exactly how far you can push your luck before your manager gets angry is mathematics.
