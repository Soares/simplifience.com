Math is like cheat codes.

I don't say this to garner appreciation for mathematics. I'm not trying to imply that math allows you to hack reality and make your life better. Quite the opposite, actually: Math is like cheat codes *for a game you aren't playing*.

Oh, sure, sometimes you're playing the right game and you know the right cheats. Then math is great. But most of the time, math students aren't playing the game that math is for.

Being a student in your average math class is like being forced to memorize cheat codes for games that you don't care about. When students ask teachers what the point is, they say things like "well you might play this game one day, and when you do, it's important to know the cheat codes."

And then when the best students finally stumble across one of the games that they memorized the codes for, they know exactly how to cheat their way through without ever really playing the game.

Being able to do calculus doesn't make you Newton. I don't care if you can derive an equation: if I *erased derivatives from your mind*, could you rebuild them? *Would* you?

Here's a news flash for math education:

> The cheat codes aren't necessary if you aren't playing the game.



We make students jump through strange hoops. We force them to memorize things which have little relevance in modern times. We teach them shortcuts to problems that they haven't encountered yet,
