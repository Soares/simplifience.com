Some people will tell you that the rules of the universe are written in mathematics.

This is backwards.

Mathematics is what happens when you write down the rules of the universe.

The universe has rules. It is predictable. If you know exactly where the billiard balls are and exactly how they're struck, you can figure out exactly where they're going.

Write those rules down. Use English, or Greek letters, or you own made up language -- it doesn't matter how you write them down. Whatever you write down is <span class="info" markdown="inline">math</span>.

<aside class="info" markdown="block">
More specifically, what you write down is a @post[formalization]reality/formalization of the rules. Math is @post[many things]foundations/mathematics.
</aside>

It's not accurate to say that the universe follows the rules of math. We write the math down in attempt to describe the universe -- so of course it follows those rules. If it didn't, we'd figure out what rules it did follow and write those down instead. That's the whole point. Physicists aren't trying to generate pretty equations -- they're trying to figure out how the universe *works*. Equations are a byproduct. They're a means of understanding the deeper meaning that they expose. Always remember that the equations describe something deeper.

You're welcome to describe the deeper thing without equations. Equations are a social construct used to describe the rules of reality.

Math is not some mystical tongue which happens to be the language of the universe. We didn't find math lying around in some ancient tomb and exclaim "Wonderful! This is perfect for describing the universe!"

Quite the contrary. Every time we find something we can't explain we have to *invent* a way to understand it. We have to invent a new formalization.

There is no static language of the universe that happens to express its rules. Rather, the rules of the universe *can* be expressed, and we happen to call any expression of the rules "mathematics".
