title: Math is Archaic
type: rules
---
The modern <span class="info" markdown="inline">language</span> of mathematics is archaic. The notation that we use to describe The Rules are confusing. The names we assign to them are poor. The whole language was made up as humanity went along, and it's poorly thought out. It's two millennia old, and it is stale.

<aside class="info" markdown="block">
Math is @post[more than the symbols]reality/symbology.
</aside>

The problem with math notation is threefold.

<aside class="caution" markdown="block">
It's policy to avoid mentioning specific @post[contrives]intro/contrives until an alternative is provided. For that reason, I have avoided @post[specific gripes]math/gripes.
</aside>

The first problem set root thousands of years ago when the ancients named things that they did not fully understand. Now we're @post[stuck with those names]allegory/trunk.

The second problem sprouted when the old names outgrew their labels. Many labels in mathematics, like @post[mathematics itself]foundations/mathematics, call similar things by the same name. This hides differences. Concepts which are simple separately are made confusing when you think they're the same thing.

The third problem is the massive corpus of mathematical rules, properties, theories, and ideas which are named after dead mathematicians in a pompous act of @post[self-congratulatory vanity]intro/names.

All of these mistakes conspire to hide the true, underlying beauty of @post[the rules]reality/rules.

Simplifience disregards the mistakes of old. We'll avoid archaic notation and the mistakes of the ancients. We won't use the stale names. We'll reject the personhood cult. In fact, we'll do away with Mathematics entirely. We'll @post[shatter the word]foundations/mathematics and distinguish between its components.

Many claim that the problems with math aren't so bad. Most of those people are mathematicians and engineers who were particularly adept or who have @post[forgotten]intro/good-enough how difficult it was to learn the cultish customs.

Others claim that it's @post[too late]intro/too-late to change, as if that helps.

We'll change anyway, for such is the road to simplifience.
