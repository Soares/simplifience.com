title: Math is Archaic
type: rules
---
The modern <span class="info" markdown="inline">language</span> of mathematics is archaic. It is thousands upon thousands of years old, and it is stale.

<aside class="info" markdown="block">
Remember that math is @post[more]reality/symbology than just the language.
</aside>

The problem with mathematics is threefold.

The first problem started when the ancients went around naming things @post[before they understood]math/circles precisely what they were, and now we're @post[stuck with those names]allegory/trunk.

The second problem arose when the followers of the ancients went around using old names for concepts that @post[didn't quite apply]math/squared. Countless entities in mathematics have outgrown their original names. Wide swaths of mathematics are outdated and counter-intuitive thanks to stale names.

The third problem is the massive corpus of mathematical rules, properties, theories, and ideas named after <span class="info" markdown="inline">dead mathematicians</span>.

<aside class="info" markdown="block">
A frivolous @post[self-congratulatory]intro/names vanity.
</aside>

All of these things conspire to hide the true, underlying beauty of mathematics. Or they would, if <span class="info" markdown="inline">mathematics were really a thing</span>.

<aside class="info" markdown="block">
Math is a loaded term that tries to mean @post[too many things]math/definition at once.
</aside>

Simplifience will be disregarding the mathematical mistakes of old. We won't use the stale names. We won't use the crufty notation. In fact, we'll do away with Mathematics entirely, preferring to distinguish between its components.

Many claim that the problems with math aren't so bad, @post[forgetting]intro/not-good-enough how difficult it was to learn the cultish customs.

Others will claim that it's @post[too late]intro/not-too-late, as if that helps matters.

We'll do it anyway.
