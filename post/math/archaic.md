The modern <span class="info" markdown="inline">language</span> of mathematics is archaic. It is thousands upon thousands of years old, and it is stale.

<aside class="info" markdown="block">
Math is @post[more than the symbols]reality/symbology.
</aside>

The problem with mathematics is threefold.

The first problem set root thousands of years ago when the ancients named things that they did not fully understand. Now we're @post[stuck with those names]allegory/trunk.

The second problem sprouted when the old names outgrew. Wide swaths of mathematics are outdated and counter-intuitive thanks to stale names.

The third problem is the massive corpus of mathematical rules, properties, theories, and ideas named after dead mathematicians in a pompous act of @post[self-congratulatory vanity]intro/names.

All of these things conspire to hide the true, underlying beauty of @post[the rules]reality/rules.

Simplifience disregards the mistakes of old. We'll avoid archaic notation and the mistakes of the ancients. We won't use the stale names. We'll reject the personhood cult. In fact, we'll do away with Mathematics entirely. We'll @post[shatter the word]foundations/mathematics and distinguish between its components.

<aside class="caution" markdown="block">
It's policy to avoid mentioning specific @post[contrives]intro/contrives until an alternative is provided. For that reason, I have avoided @post[specific gripes]math/gripes.
</aside>

Many claim that the problems with math aren't so bad, @post[forgetting]intro/good-enough how difficult it was to learn the cultish customs.

Others claim that it's @post[too late]intro/too-late, as if that helps matters.

We'll do it anyway, for such is the road to simplifience.
