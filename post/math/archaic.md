title: Math is Archaic
type: rules
---
The modern <span class="info" markdown="inline">language</span> of mathematics is archaic. It is thousands upon thousands of years old, and it is stale.

<aside class="info" markdown="block">
Remember that math is @post[more]reality/symbology than just the language.
</aside>

The problem with mathematics is threefold:

First the ancients went around naming things <span class="info" markdown="inline">before they understood</span> precisely what they were, and now we're @post[stuck with those names]allegory/trunk.

<aside class="info" markdown="block">
That whole misstep with @post[circles]math/circles is perhaps the most well-known example.
</aside>

Then everybody else went around using old names for concepts that @post[didn't quite apply]math/squared. Countless things in mathematics have either outgrown or outdated their names, making a huge amount of mathematics counter-intuitive when it needn't be.

The third problem is the massive corpus of mathematical rules, properties, theories, and ideas named after <span class="info" markdown="inline">dead mathematicians</span>.

<aside class="info" markdown="block">
A frivolous act of @post[wankery]intro/names that helps no one.
</aside>

All of these things conspire to hide the true, underlying beauty of mathematics. Or they would, if <span class="info" markdown="inline">mathematics were really a thing</span>.

<aside class="info" markdown="block">
Math is a loaded term that tries to mean @post[too many things]math/definition at once.
</aside>

Simplifience will be disregarding the mathematical mistakes of old. We won't use the silly old names. We won't use the crufty old notation. In fact, we'll do away with Mathematics entirely, preferring to distinguish between its components.

Many claim that the problems with math aren't so bad, @post[forgetting]intro/not-good-enough how difficult it was to learn the cultish customs.

Others will claim that it's @post[too late]intro/not-too-late, as if that helps matters.

We'll do it anyway.
