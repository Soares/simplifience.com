title: Math is Archaic

The modern language of mathematics is archaic. The notation that we use to describe @post[The Rules]reality/rules is confusing. The names we assign to the symbols are poor. The whole language was made up as humanity went along. It's poorly thought out. It's two millennia old, and it has grown stale.

<aside class="caution" markdown="block">
It's policy to avoid mentioning specific @post[contrives]intro/decontriving until an alternative is understood. For that reason I have avoided @post[specific gripes]math/gripes.

The problem with mathematics is in the names.

Names are important. They drive our thoughts. When our names become disconnected with the things they describe, @post[we become confused]reality/connected. It is easy to forget that the @post[symbols are separate from the substance]reality/symbology.

The problem with the language of mathematics is threefold.

The first problem set root thousands of years ago when the ancients named things that they did not fully understand. Now we're @post[stuck with those names]allegory/trunk.

The second problem sprouted when the old names outgrew their labels. Many labels in mathematics, like @post[mathematics itself]foundations/mathematics, call similar things by the same name. This hides differences. Concepts which are simple separately are made confusing when you think they're the same thing.

The third problem is the massive corpus of mathematical rules, properties, theories, and ideas which are named after dead mathematicians in a pompous act of @post[self-congratulatory vanity]intro/names.

All of these mistakes conspire to hide the true, underlying beauty of @post[the rules]reality/rules.

Simplifience disregards the mistakes of old. We'll avoid archaic notation and the mistakes of the ancients. We won't use the stale names. We'll reject the personhood cult. In fact, we'll do away with Mathematics entirely. We'll @post[shatter the word]foundations/mathematics and distinguish between its components.

Many claim that the problems with math aren't so bad. Most of those people are mathematicians and engineers who were particularly adept or who have @post[forgotten]intro/good-enough how difficult it was to learn the cultish customs.

Others claim that it's @post[too late]intro/too-late to change, as if that helps.

We'll change anyway, for such is the road to simplifience.
