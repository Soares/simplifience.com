There are many true things you can say about the universe. Very few of them are laws of physics.

Perhaps you stumble across a red frog. It is accurate to say "some frogs are red". It's innacurate to conclude that all frogs are red. And the redness of frogs is certainly not one of the laws of the universe.

The laws of the universe are the things that are true *everywhere*, without exception.

If you ever find an exception, then the rule wasn't one of the laws. If you ever *could* find an exception, in principle, then the rule isn't one of the laws. [LINK TO SOME OF THE LAW ARTICLES ETC]

The laws of physics are exactly the things that are always true, everywhere in the universe, without exception. It doesn't matter where you're standing, or which direction you're looking in. Turning your head doesn't change the laws of physics. Going to space doesn't change the laws of physics. In fact, the laws of physics are precisely those things which don't change, no matter how much you tilt your head and squint your eyes.

The universe doesn't care about your perspective. It doesn't care where you're standing. It doesn't care whether you're moving, or spinning, or doing jumping jacks. All of these things are *internal* to the universe, and none of them change the laws of physics.

They can change the way you see the laws of physics, certainly. A man on a train seems to be moving fast if you're outside the train, and sitting still if you're on the train. Changing your perspective can change how things look to you. But it does not change the laws of physics.

Newton's laws are not laws of physics. If you don't believe me, [get on a carousel](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GiMi-QPt1Xk) and toss a ball around. You'll find it angling off in weird directions once thrown, travelling along a curved path in the absence of forces.

Newton knew this, of course, and his equations weren't wrong. There are specific situations in which Newton's laws look correct. They work when you're analyzing spinning things, but not when your *are* spinning. <-- Sucks.

The point is that *there are places in the world where Newton's laws don't apply*. If you're spinning around on a caurosel, objects don't seem to travel in straight lines. You would disagree with Newton that there are no exceptions to his laws.

And yet, Newton's laws seem to be saying something true. Even though objects curve away from you when you're spinning, they do so in just such a way that an outside observer would conclude that they were travelling in straight lines. And they curve away from you the same way every time. So while Newton's formulation may not be the true laws of physics, they seem like they're saying *something* about how objects travel, if not the full story.

What is the full story? We'll get to that. The point of the day is that laws of physics are everywhere true, and Newton's laws aren't. End of story.

The universe doesn't care what you think, or where you're standing, it keeps acting the same way. It doesn't care how fast you're moving, it keeps acting the same way. The laws of physics, then, must not depend upon where you are, where you're standing, where you're looking, or how fast you're going.

Reality has no backdrop.

When you picture all things that exist, perhaps you imagine them from a viewpoint above and to the left, looking down on all that is, suspended against a featureless field of black.

That's not how reality works. You cannot step outside of all that exists. The viewpoint and the field of black: if they exist, then they too are part of reality.

You cannot take an outside view of existence. This is hard to picture: the human mind doesn't know how to paint you a picture without a backdrop. This single failure of intuition is responsible for much confusion about the <span class="main">nature of reality</span>.

<aside class="main" markdown="block">
Similar misconceptions lead to grave misunderstandings of time.
</aside>

Suffice to say, you cannot trust your mental image of reality.

*Reality has no backdrop.*

All existence cannot move, because there is nothing for it to move against. There is no featureless space outside everything that everything is rumbling past. There could be some featureless expanse beyond the visible universe, surely, though that does not seem to be the case. It's possible that *the known universe* is moving with respect to some giant curtain.

But reality includes that curtain too. Existence includes all things: and all things cannot be moving.

The immovability of reality isn't your normal sort of impossibility. It's not a run-of-the-mill impossible like unassissted human flight. It's a @post[deeper sort of impossibility]allegory/axe.

Reality cannot be moving because *the very concept of it does not make sense.* Reality cannot be moved in the same way that an axe cannot be removed from its handle and its blade. In order to move, there must be a space to move through, a reference object to move against. All existence, considered as a whole, has no available peers.

This question is common among newcomers to physics. How would you answer?

<MEDITATION>
> Is the universe moving? How could we know?

In order to understand modern physics, you need to do more than answer this question. You need to disolve this question. You need to unask it.

This question should feel wrong to you, like trying to remove an axe from the handle and the blade. How can the collection of all things be moving? Your mind readily pictures a bundle of objects moving against a backdrop, so add the backdrop to the bundle, and [stop trusting your imagination]. Now: can reality be moving?

Once that question stops feeling like a query about reality and starts feeling like an abuse of words, you're ready to learn physics.
