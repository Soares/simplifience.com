title: Backdrop

Reality has no backdrop.

When you picture all things that exist, perhaps you imagine them from a viewpoint above and to the left, looking down on all that is, suspended against a featureless field of black.

That's not how reality works. You cannot step outside of existence. Any platform where you can stand and view reality, any field of black that it hangs against: these too, if they are real, are part of reality.

You cannot take an outside view of existence. Reality does not hang suspended. Reality has no backdrop.

This is difficult to picture: your mind can't paint you a picture without a background. Suffice to say, you cannot trust your mental image of reality.

*Reality has no backdrop.*

Internalizing this fact clears up a number of physical misconceptions. Consider, for example, the following question:

<div class="simplifience" markdown="block">
What if everything was moving east?
</div>

You can probably picture this occurrence. You can picture the planet moving eastward, because the solar system is moving east, because the galaxy is moving east, because the universe is moving east. If there's something outside the universe, you can imagine that moving east, too.

*This is a failure of your imagination.*

Reality cannot be moving east, because there is nothing for it to move against. There is no expanse outside of space and time that everything can rumble past. Whatever backdrop you imagine, reality includes that too. Can your backdrop, also, be moving east?

Existence includes all things, and all things cannot be moving.

The immovability of reality isn't your normal everyday impossibility. It's not a run-of-the-mill impossibility like human flight. It's an impossibility of a @post[deeper kind]allegory/axe.

Reality cannot be moving because *the very concept does not make sense*. Reality cannot be moving because idea is malformed, because the statement is an abuse against the concept of movement.

Reality cannot be moved in the same way that an axe cannot be removed from its handle and its blade. In order to move, there must be a space to move through, a reference to move against. And reality, which has no background, has no peers. There is no reference. The word "movement" cannot apply.

Misconceptions such as this are the root of much confusion.

Newcomers to physics are entranced by thought experiments like the following. What is your reply?

{% call post.meditation('slow-time', 'What if time slowed down?') %}
What if the time between instants suddenly got longer? We don't feel time between instants, so perhaps between each instant everything is frozen perfectly for a thousand years and then suddenly it all starts up again. We'd never feel it!
<br/><br/>
Is this happening? How could we know?
{% endcall %}

The answer, of course, is that there's no time outside of reality. Just like there is no spacial backdrop outside everything, there is also no master stopwatch above the stars. Time is *inside* reality. It cannot slow down, nor stop, because *there is no master stopwatch for it to stop relative to.*

Your brain has trouble believing this. Time is implicit in human imagination. It feels like we can imagine the universe stopped, because we just picture everything frozen and we imagine it lasting a thousand years — *because your brain is automatically imagining a higher stopwatch*. Until you've fixed this misconception, you cannot trust your imagination.

What if everything was moving? What if the amount of time passing, for everything, got longer? How could we know? What would it feel like?

In order to understand reality, you need to do more than answer these questions. You need to dissolve them. You need to unask them.

These questions should feel wrong to you, like trying to remove an axe from the handle and the blade. These questions should sound ridiculous, like they're abusing the concepts of motion. How could someone even propose that all existence is moving? What is it moving against? If your mind pictures a bundle of objects moving against a backdrop, then add the backdrop to the bundle and stop trusting your imagination.

Then ask yourself again: what if all reality was moving east?

Once that question stops feeling like a query about reality and starts feeling like an abuse of words, you're ready to begin.
