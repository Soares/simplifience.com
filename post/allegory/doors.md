"I hate this class", Sarah muttered.

"It's going to be important", Rose insisted, fiddling with the lock. "You've got to open doors every day of your life.

Sarah sniffed. "Yeah, but I learned how to open house doors and kitchen doors and stuff in like *first grade*. *This* stuff is pointless."

"Pointless?" Mary gasped. "Sarah, there are some very important jobs that require you to know how to open doors."

"You can just walk around!" Sarah cried, gesturing towards the lone door frame squatting in the center of the empty classroom. The sun had just disappeared behind the mountains but nobody'd turned the lights on yet, so the girls stood in twilight. The door frame creaked a bit as Rose jerked her hand, cursing at the lock as she fiddled with her picks.

"Yeah, well, you aren't going to find just door frames in real life", Mary said. "In the *real* world, doors are going to be attached to walls."

"Yeah, but in the real world I'm also not going to need to pick locks."

"What if you lock yourself out of your car?"

"Then I'll call a locksmith. Or triple A."

Mary rolled her eyes. "You can't just use technology to get out of every problem, Sarah. You've got to *know* this sort of stuff."

"Really? Why? I already know how to open house doors. I'm *great* at opening car doors. I opened car doors *twice* in order to get to this stupid practice session that *isn't even necessary.*"

"And yet I don't see you breezing through this lock", Rose muttered, hands busy with her lock picks.

"I can open all the door types I need to", Sarah insisted. "And I bet I *could* pick that lock in two minutes flat. But it's still pointless."

"But what about military bunker doors?" Mary countered. "Or space shuttle hatches?"

"If I ever decide to become an astronaut maybe then I'll learn how to open space shuttle hatches."

Rose snorted again. "Yeah, like they're ever going to accept an astronaut that doesn't know how to open space shuttle hatches."

Sarah stomped her foot. "Then I won't be an astronaut."

Mary rolled her eyes. "We've still got to prepare people."

"It's stupid and boring", Sarah insisted, "and we're never going to need to know this stuff."

"Uh, yeah you are", Mary reminded her. "Anatomy of a Door is on the state exams."

"Pop quiz", Rose muttered sarcastically, "essay on how transoms evolved in the last two hundred years."

"It doesn't matter!" Sarah practically shouted. "I shouldn't need to know what a transom is in order to *open doors!*"

"All right, miss genius", Mary said, sarcasm dripping from her voice. "How would *you* teach door-opening?"

"I wouldn't!" she cried. "I mean, like, sure, we'd still show kids how to open doors. When they're like, four to six. Teach them how car handles and doorknobs work. But, like, you don't really need to *teach* that in a class. You can just show them."

"Yeah, that's hardly going to help the first time they find a garage door with a remote door opener", Mary said.

"Or one of those old garage doors with a string on it", Rose chimed. "Those ones are a doozy. And you can't really teach that to little kids, they're just not tall enough to open them."

"So what!" Sara shouted. "You teach them to open those doors when they're tall enough. They can *learn as they go along.*"

"You think we should spend the first half of Shop class teaching kids how to open the garage door?" Rose protested. "That's not fair to the kids who can already open garage doors by the time they get to Shop class."

"Yeah, and what if they learn the wrong way?" Mary piped up. "What if, like, they come to some double doors and they open the left side instead of the right side like everyone else?"

"Well, do they still get in the building?"

"Yeah, but it's not compatible with how everyone else is doing it."

"Who cares?"

"They could, like, be going against the traffic --"

"In which case they'll use the other side next time."

"Well what if like someone else opens the side that they aren't used to opening?"

"Then they walk through it. It's not rocket science."

"Yeah, but if they didn't learn to open the left side --"

"They'll figure it out when they're put in context!" Sarah exclaimed. "It's not that hard!"

"Sure, maybe it's not hard for *you*", Rose slammed a hand against the door in frustration as one of her lock picks broke. "I don't know what you're whining about, you're better at door-opening than all of us."

"That doesn't make the class any less stupid!"

"Just because it comes naturally to you doesn't mean it comes naturally to everyone. Look how many people are failing this class."

"Yeah, because this class is *pointless*. Most people don't need to be able to pick a lock or board a space shuttle in their everyday lives."

"It's a life skill", Mary shrugged.

"It is *not* a life skill!" Sarah shouted. "Memorizing all of the different types of doors that the school thinks are important doesn't teach you *anything* about really getting yourself from point A to point B. If we just taught people good motor skills, a bit of dexterity, and a touch of cleverness then they'll be able to open any door that's in their way and they'll *also* be able to climb through windows, hop over puddles, and cross bridges."

"Woah there", Rose said. "I think you give people too much credit. Those are like, Masters level subjects. At least."
