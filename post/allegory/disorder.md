title: Totally Unpredictable

You snorted with concept as you walked home. @post[Reality follows rules]reality/order -- how boring. Who thought that one up? If reality was just a little less lax about all those cold hard rules, maybe there would be @post[fairies]reality/beauty and dragons and unicorns and stuff, instead of just @post[boring old rainbows]reality/magic.

Or at the very least, you could fly for a little while, right? Who needs gravity.

You go to sleep, wishing reality could be a little less lax in obeying its own rules.

You wake up, which for some reason doesn't surprise you. You're still in your room, and even though the lights are off and the blinds are closed you generally know where everything is -- it hasn't moved, as you know it shouldn't. Your arms are still attached to your shoulders. Air still flows through your nostrils. Oxygen still rides through your veins. You take all this for granted, of course, as you get up and dress yourself and go outside.

Then everything lurches.

You're thrown sideways as reality shudders under the iron chains of gravity. You would have thought that gravity would just turn off -- but reality isn't following your rules any more than it's following its own. You fly left, slamming into a wall of a sandwich shop. Everything lurches. You pick yourself up off of the wall (which now feels much like  a floor) and giggle. You aren't hurt, and this is kind of cool, actually. Gravity lurches again, and you go flying in the opposite direction, your stomach lurching. You manage to catch a passing lamp post and use that as the floor instead -- before the earth's gravity disappears entirely.

The wind whips around you, as the atmosphere (also affected by gravity), responds to the tumultuous change. Air slowly drifts away from the planet earth, and into space. You're not immediately worried, because there's a lot of air left, and the rules are being broken now -- you'll probably live through it. You're glad that the rules of electricity haven't changed yet, because your brain sort of relies upon those to work.

Then, suddenly, the sun is a cake.

You look up, confused, as a chill passes through your body -- the suns rays no longer warm the earth.

But that doesn't matter any more, because the rules are slowly leaving. Green plants spring up from the ground in blithe defiance of the laws of physics, gnas̴hing their teeth at the sky. A ̡pink hippopotamus the size of a bulldozer charges between two crumbling buildings to eat them.̱̠ As he bites down, light shoots from his his teeth turn to the darkness and the complex houses married and single bananas and their families fly like a time arrow when the stream of <span style="font-size: 1.1em">dread c͒ͪo͛ͫrrup</span>tion fills the lun̨gs to b<span style="font-size 1.2em">urst</span>ing̉ until the dèa͔̱th͡ly aura <span style="font-size: 0.9em">of uneart</span>hly doom ri͕̳ͥ͠·ses until it completel̶y f̶i͒ll̡s the sḱi͖ęs̨ͧ and the fee̘ļi̸ñ͇gs w͖ḩic͓hͥ rͨunͅ t̉h̗r̂ouͅg͑h̓ *y͠ou΅ ha͂v̤ë́ n̰o̒ c̲ọu̇r͒sͣĕ* as t̗h̑e̓y̖ **c̔o̡u̗͢r̸s̓ḛ̙͓̑̄͂̓́ a̦͆̃n̸d̨͙́ ṫh̨̗͉͆́̇e̡̨̔͂͢ ṡ͢ky̡ _p̢̲̈́u̡̅ḻ̓ʹś̅é·̠̣s_**…
