title: Ground Rules

Here's the ground rules:

I'm going to tell you about the universe.

I'm going to do it in a web page that looks like this.

Sometimes there will be pictures. Some of them are published under the creative commons license with attribution required. Hover over the image to see the attribution.

![Lightning!](/images/lightning.jpg){:title="Not this one! This is public domain."}

Now, on to the content of the site:

First and foremost, you should know that *I will be wrong*.

Sometimes I will be wrong <span class="rigor">on purpose</span>, just for a little while, to make things simpler. I'll correct these mistakes as I go along.

<aside class="rigor">
In which case I'll tell you about it in the side commentary.
</aside>

Sometimes I will be wrong because human knowledge is incorrect. @post[Nothing can be proven true]prove-it, and there's always the possibility that [things aren't what they seem](http://lesswrong.com/lw/jr/how_to_convince_me_that_2_2_3/). Time and again, science has <span class="knowledge">proven our knowledge wrong</span>, and we've had to adapt. That may, and likely will, happen again.

<aside class="knowledge">
Note that established science is superseded, not discarded. When we found out that our theory of gravity was wrong, we didn't stop sticking to the planet.
</aside>

But most importantly, sometimes I'm going to be wrong because I've made an error, <span class="info">either in my own understanding</span> or in my presentation. When that happens, and you notice it, *please* <a href="mailto:nate@simplifience.com">let me know</a>.

<aside class="info">
I plan to cover a wide range of topics here, and some of them are a little out of my weight class.
</aside>

Until then, I'm going to be speaking in a concise, confident tone for the sake of simplicity. Where there are multiple interpretations, I am going to pick the one I find simplest and run with it. I am not going to teach any <span class="info">controversies</span>. @post[Rigor is not my goal]rigor.

<aside class="info">
Though I may mention them in the side commentary.
</aside>

As you've noticed by now, there's going to be side commentary going on in
colored boxes. Different colors mean different things. The <span class="info">teal boxes</span> are neutral commentary.

<aside class="info">
Hello there!
</aside>

These side boxes are <span class="knowledge">experiment boxes</span>.

<aside class="knowledge">
They'll tell you about experiments you can do to see something for yourself.
</aside>

We also have <span class="rules">math boxes</span>

<aside class="rules">
Where you can often find links to more rigorous proofs.
</aside>

There's the <span class="caution">caution box</span>

<aside class="caution">
Careful! Don't make the same mistake that many others make!
</aside>

Then there's <span class="define">definition boxes</span>, which are very important. Keep an eye out for them.

<aside class="define">
In these I define uncommon words and new phrases that I've made up.
</aside>

We have <span class="rigor">rigor boxes</span>.

<aside class="rigor">
Here I let you know when I've been lying for the sake of simplicity.
</aside>

Perhaps most importantly, we have <span class="rant">rant boxes</span> where
I discuss something that pervades common mathematics and science which is
nevertheless a *bad explanation*. They're wrong as in confusing, not necessarily
wrong as in incorrect.

<aside class="rant">
$\pi$, $i$, $p=mv$, $e^{i\pi}=1$.
<br/>
The force of gravity.
</aside>

I won't explain the wrong things in my main articles, nor will I explain why
they're wrong. I don't want to muddle the point. Red boxes are your indication
that the mainstream has something muddled.

On occasion I'll write a <span class="info">refutory</span> article targeting one particular point of contention with the mainstream. In general, though, the policy is to ignore the confusing terminology entirely.

<aside class="info">Refutory articles will have angry headers. You'll recognize them.</aside>

And, finally, we have <span class="simplifience">simplifience boxes</span>. They're my favorite.

<aside class="simplifience">
Where I point out concepts that embody the spirit of simplifience.
</aside>

Don't <span class="info">memorize</span> these. The purpose of the box will be quite clear from the context. I just like stating the rules before I dive into things.

<aside class="info">
Don't memorize anything! Memorization is silly.
</aside>
