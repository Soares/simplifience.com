$e^{\pi i}$ is a silly notation for $(grow\ 1\ \pi i)$. Perpendicular growth is circular motion, so $e^{\pi i}$ can be translated as $(rotate\ 1\ \pi)$. In english:

> $e^{\pi i}$ means "rotate $1$ by $\pi$ radius-lengths"

This leaves you halfway around the circle, at $\text{--}1$.

This is a much better state of affairs than before, but it still isn't how math should be.

It's easy to say that you now have a better intuition for $e$, $i$, and $\pi$. It's easy to say that you're now better at mathematics. It's easy to say "see, $e$ and $i$ aren't that hard".

It's harder to notice that *they never should have been so hard to learn in the first place*. Euler's identity never should have existed. We shouldn't have had used maddening syntax and imaginary exponentiation to talk about *walking around circles*.

It's interesting that perpendicular growth is the same as circular motion, but you don't need to know that in order to know that walking halfway around the unit circle takes you from one to negative one.

It's interesting that growth can be calculated by $\displaystyle \lim\_{n \to \infty} p * (1 + \frac{rate}{n})^n$ but you don't need to memorize this to understand growth. This is something that you should be able to derive, but not something that should be part of the syntax.

You're beginning to see the problem with mainstream mathematics. There are a few. The first problem is that common math education doesn't teach you things the easy way. Most people have had to memorize $i$ and learn that $i\*i = \text{--}1$ without ever being taught that the complex number plane is just another add-on to the number line.

The second problem is that the things you're taught the hard way are themselves contrived. It would be nice if someone had taught you explicitly that $\pi$ is the number of radiuses it takes to go halfway around a circle. It would be *better* if you never learned $\pi$ at all and just learned everything in turns. Why do you need a special symbol for "half a turn"?

This is what's wrong with mathematics. The symbols are @post[needlessly complicated]intro/contrives *and* you're taught them in a counter-intuitive manner.

This is why we need @post[simplifience]intro/motivation.
