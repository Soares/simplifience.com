<div class="caution" markdown="block">
This is not a standard simplifience article. It provides a brief view of the nature of $\pi$ as is necessary to understand @post[Euler's identity]sample/identity. Both $\pi$ and Euler's identity are @post[contrives]intro/contrives. As a @post[matter of policy]intro/taboo contrives are not mentioned.

This article is an exception to that rule. It's part of an sequence designed to show how "difficult", when taught from a different point of view, feels intuitive. If you already have a good intuition for $\pi$ you're encouraged to skip this article.

You've probably been taught that $\pi ≈ 3.14$. You might know it has something to do with circles. More specifically, $\pi$ is the ratio of a circle's circumference to it's diameter. If you walk $\pi$ diameters around a circle you'll come all the way around.

As it turns out, circles with *radius* $1$ are way more useful than circles with diameter $1$. Both reality and mathematics (Euler's identity included) are littered with circles where the radius is the natural unit. When we're using radius-based circles $\pi$ isn't a very important number. What we usually care about is the number of <span class="info" markdown="inline">radius lengths</span> in the circumference of a circle.

$\pi$ is one of the most popular @post[contrives]intro/contrives in mainstream mathematics. $\pi$ is the number of radius-lengths in a *half-turn*, not a full turn. This is a silly unit to pick as your measuring stick. A @post[quarter turn]sample/imagine (right angle) and a [full turn](http://tauday.com) ($\tau$) are the natural units when working with circles.

Ignore all that for now. In order to understand Euler's identity, all you need to remember is this:

> Walking $\pi$ radius-lengths takes you halfway around a circle.

<aside class="info" markdown="block">
When you unroll $\pi$ radius lengths you only unroll the circle halfway.
