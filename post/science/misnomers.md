title: Science Misnomers
type: knowledge
stub: |
  Science is a method of thinking. It's told us many things about the workings of reality. The names that we humans have made up for such things are most often poor names.
  The charges in electricity are backwards. Important properties are named after long-dead people. This is silly.
