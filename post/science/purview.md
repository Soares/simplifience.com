title: The Domain of Science
type: knowledge

Science is not the name of our accumulated knowledge of @post[the rules of reality]reality/rules. Science is what brought us The Rules, but science is not the rules themselves. Science is a @post[method of thinking]science/method. Science is how we uncover the unknown laws of nature.

It is common knowledge that science is biology, and physics, and chemistry, and all those boring subjects that we already know. Never mind that these fields were extraordinary and awe-inspiring when their foundations were first uncovered. Once everybody knows them -- or, at least, once everybody can know them -- the luster is gone.

It's also common knowledge that certain domains lie outside the purview of science. Intelligence. Awareness. The nature of consciousness. Why being alive feels like this.

This is faulty thinking. The domain of science is not the things that we already know. The things that we already know are called "knowledge". Science's purview, science's domain, is everything *else*.

Remember the mistakes of [Vitalism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitalism). The vitalists believed that you couldn't explain animate life. They believed that the body's animation stems from the intangible vitality of the spirit, "Ã‰lan Vital". After all, your muscles were just flesh. What gave them movement? It must be none other than the human willpower.

This wasn't really an explanation. It didn't tell you how your muscles moved. It didn't lead to antibiotics or dietary techniques. It sure *felt* like an explanation, but @post[science isn't about feeling like you have answers]science/mistakes.

Vitalism was popular in the early 1900s. Surely, science could explain the mechanical motion of objects. It could explain electric shocks and light beams and the action of molecules. But it couldn't explain *animation*. Human life moved at a conscious thought, at science couldn't explain that.

Then scientists synthesized urea, a component of urine, showing that the actions of bodies are not exempt from science, and the walls began to crumble. Within a few short decades we began to understand how muscles *actually* move. We began to understand how the interactions of individual cells create muscle contractions. We discovered how your nerves transmit pain. We *learned* how life is animated, and it led to huge improvements in medicine and longevity.

The vitalists did not understand the purview of science. To them, science was for the stars and the planets and the rocks, but it couldn't explain animate life. Life was the sacred mystery.

But they misunderstood science. Mystery is not a property of reality: @post[mystery is in your mind]reality/mystery. The domain of science is not the things we already know. Science helped us uncover those things, and now science has left.

The domain of science is exactly everything which we *don't* know. It is all the mysteries remaining.

Science has always been about reconstructing the sacred mysteries and figuring out how they work. @post[This does not devalue them]reality/mere. If anything, reconstructing the mysteries makes them more awe-inspiring. But science has always been here to infringe upon the great mysteries, and that has always made people uncomfortable.

We act like we've accepted science into the fold, because it has helped us uncover so much of the nature of reality. But in every generation, it feels like science is done. The things we've uncovered seem mundane, now, and so science must be for the mundane.

Every generation must come to terms with two facts. First, @post[things are not mundane just because we know them]reality/magic. Second, science isn't about the mundane: it's about the mysteries. Everything you think science can't explain is exactly what it must explain next.

The world is not mysterious: the world just is. The mystery is in our eyes, when we look at reality and fail to understand. Science is what removes our blinders.
