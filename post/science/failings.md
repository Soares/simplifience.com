title: Where Science Fails
type: knowledge
---
Science is the realization that humans can't figure out how reality works by heated arguments in closed rooms. Science is the claim that in order to understand how the universe works, you have to go check the actual universe and then listen to what it says.

This paradigm proved far better and advancing civilization than did the previous paradigms, which roughly amounted to "make up cool stories".

And yet, science is not good enough.

As a method for uncovering new truths, science is far better than what came before. But it is @post[not the end of the line]bias/normalcy. The method of science has <span class="info" markdown="inline">many failings</span>.

The wrongness of science is not an excuse to continue believing your favorite unsubstantiated theory. Science is wrong, but if you wish to replace it you must replace it with something better.

[Science isn't strict enough](http://lesswrong.com/lw/qd/science_isnt_strict_enough/).

So long as many theories predict the same results, science does not help you choose the best theory.

Science lets you believe any theory you like, so long as it has not yet been falsified.

If the church discovered the laws of gravity, and concluded that gravity worked by dint of [tiny angels beating their wings](http://books.google.com/books?id=44ihCUS1XQMC&pg=PA5&lpg=PA5&dq=%22what%20makes%20planets%20go%20around%20the%20sun?%22#v=onepage&q=%22what%20makes%20planets%20go%20around%20the%20sun%3F%22&f=false), science would not protest. The theory makes predictions and is falsifiable. A good scientist is welcome to go on believing the angles.

Gravity-angels don't exist. Tacking irrefutable excess onto a theory doesn't make it true. But if you do, science isn't strong enough to help you.

The believers of gravity-angles point to the theory of gravity (with angels) and protest you can't come up with a testable falsifiable reason to discard the angels and be left with bare gravity. And they're right, under science.

> Science isn't strong enough.

Science preferences the first theory to explain things, even if it comes with baggage. Science gives you tools to discard bad hypotheses, but does not give you the means to choose the best hypothesis from a bunch of good ones.

When you are lost, science doesn't help you choose where to look next. A good scientist tests whatever theory they choose, regardless of how unlikely it seems. Falsification of even the most outlandish claim is still good information, and still advances human knowledge by a tiny amount.

There are infinite variations of increasingly likely wrong hypotheses that humans can test as dutiful virtuous scientists, but that won't help us pluck the real rules of reality from the void.

Science is *good enough* -- it ensures that we keep taking evidence and that we discard wrong theories. It doesn't help us discriminate, and it doesn't point us towards the right theories, but it's good enough for civilization so far. Though it may be slow, the ratchet of science moves ever forward.

That may be good enough for civilization, but it's not the best.

If we want to pluck the true rules of the universe from the void, if we want to discover how reality works before the sun burns down, if we want to be *right* instead of just *not wrong*, then we need something more than science.

We're going to have to step beyond.
