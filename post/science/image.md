Science has an image problem.

It may be [starting](http://www.haydenplanetarium.org/tyson/) to [change](https://www.facebook.com/IFeakingLoveScience), but scientists themselves are in a bind.

This image problem is best exemplified in the [Dresden files](http://www.jim-butcher.com/books/dresden), a fun book series centered around a professional wizard in Chicago. In Harry Dresden's world, magic is real. Nobody notices, because whenever someone encounters the supernatural they rationalize it away, preferring the comfort of their normal lives.

Scientists in particular rationalize away all the evidence of magic that they see, preferring their cold precise models. They *know* how reality is, because it says so in their textbooks, and they aren't able to see the magic in the world.

It's a prevalent sentiment. Spock is cold and calculating, his rationality depriving him of his emotions. Muggle scientists never notice a hint of magic. This is the Hollywood misconception of scientists: cold, rational men turning the cranks on their cold, rational formulas.

Nothing could be further from the truth.

Being a scientist isn't about fawning over the models which describe how reality works. They're not the guardians of the Holy Textbooks. Humans weren't plopped down on Earth in the year 2000 and handed a list of rules to follow and defend.

No, scientists *built* those rules. Scientist had to *discover* how reality worked. They had to go out there into the wild unknown, with no idea what the universe held in store for them, and they had to wrest Understanding kicking and screaming from the chaos. They had to drag the rules of reality into the light, inch by arduous inch.

Science isn't about memorizing the rules of reality. Science isn't about applying the rules of reality. Science is about *finding* the rules.

Science has *never* been about following rules. Science began its life as a rebellion against authority. The earth was not flat, despite what everybody believed. Science is about bucking the status quo, dropping the blinders of tradition, and actually *looking* at reality. Science is about listening to the evidence, not to the established 'common sense'.

Science is about listening to what reality has to say, *even when it sounds ridiculous*. It's about realizing that the earth circles the sun, despite the fact that everyone thinks you're wrong. When the rest of the world ignored the facts beneath their noses and hallucinated excuses, scientists pierced the veil and saw what *really* lies beyond.

In a world of magic, scientists aren't cold men cooped up in offices clutching their models tight. Scientists aren't the people in lab coats who rationalize away any evidence that doesn't seem to fit. Scientists aren't the ones screwing their eyes shut and making up excuses.

Scientists are the ones tearing off the blindfolds and staring reality in the eyes.

Scientists are the wizards.
