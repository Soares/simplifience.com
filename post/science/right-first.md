Modern science education teaches @post[wrongs first]science/wrong-first. Despite the fact that the worldview of science has shifted drastically in the last century, the shift in perspective is only taught alongside the technical details supporting the perspective shift.

Only the most technically proficient ever learn about the massive perspective shift in fundamental physics, which trickles down only imperfectly to the masses. The most fundamental laws of reality that we know -- relativity and quantum mechanics -- still appear foreign and incomprehensible to the laypeople.

Science is caught in a catch-22. Shifting perspectives is hard. Tearing down an entire worldview is harder. So long as the antiquated view is the norm we can't just teach the right view: we have to defeat the old view. So long as the general population learns the classical view, so long as fathers answer their daughter's "Why?"s in ways that subtly reinforce a classical view, it is difficult for education to overcome the cultural inertia. A simple explanation isn't enough: in order to tear down the misconceptions sciecne is obligated to provide technical arguments and mountains of evidence.

And so the cycle completes itself: only students advanced enough to understand the technical arguments ever learn the new perspective. Even then they find it difficult to tear down their misconceptions. The populace at large sees their difficulty and concludes that the secrets of science are beyond them: and the classical view persists.

Simplifience exists to break that cycle. We are here to teach the right way *first*. It may be somewhat uncomfortable: the classical viewpoint is ingrained in our culture and subtly reinforced by our language. But the cycle has to be broken somewhere.

Simplifience will teach you the right way first, to the best of current human knowledge. We won't flinch from the truth.

It will be a little difficult to tear down the antiquated perspective of ancient philosophers. Your culture and your language will conspire against you. But if you can shift your perspective early enough then you can avoid the mistaken assumptions of the past. If you manage to avoid the pitfalls of the past, physics won't be difficult. It will be intuitive.

To make matters worse, science is taught from the perspective of @post[resolved confusions]science/mire. We drag students through the ancient confusions and then surprise them with the conclusions instead of building up intuitions that can avoid the confusions entirely. We
