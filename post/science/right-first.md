Modern science education teaches @post[wrongs first]science/wrong-first from a perspective of @post[resolved confusions]science/mire. Despite the fact that the world-view of science has shifted drastically in the last century, the shift in perspective is only taught alongside the technical details supporting the perspective shift.

Only the most technically proficient ever learn about the massive perspective shift in fundamental physics, which trickles down only imperfectly to the masses. By this phenomenon, the most fundamental laws of reality that we know -- relativity and quantum mechanics -- still appear foreign and incomprehensible to the laypeople.

The laypeople retain the antiquated world-view and science is caught in a catch-22. Shifting your perspective is hard. Tearing down your entire world view is *hard*. So long as the antiquated view is the norm we can't just teach the right view. We have to defeat the old view. So long as the general population learns the classical view, so long as fathers answer their daughter's "Why?"s with answers that subtly reinforce the old ways, it is difficult for education to overcome the old view. A simple explanation isn't enough: in order to overcome the old ways, science education must present technical arguments and mounds of evidence.

And so the cycle completes itself: only the advanced students learn the new perspective, and only after tearing down their broken world view with difficulty. The populace at large sees their difficulty and concludes that the secrets of science are beyond them. The old view persists.

Simplifience exists to break that cycle. We are here to teach the right way *first*. It may be somewhat uncomfortable: the classical viewpoint is ingrained in our culture and subtly reinforced by our language. But the cycle has to be broken somewhere.

Simplifience will teach you the right way first, to the best of current human knowledge. We won't flinch from the truth. @post[We won't make you master dendrology before telling you that the World Tree is actually the leg of the Great Elephant]allegory/trunk.

It will be a little difficult to tear down the antiquated perspective of ancient philosophers. Your culture and your language will conspire against you. But if you can shift your perspective then you can avoid the mistaken assumptions of the past. If you avoid the confusions of the past, the science will seem almost obvious.
