Science education is broken in much the same way that @post[math education is broken]math/education.

The sentiment is very similar: it is much more valuable for students to learn how to do science than it is for them to learn the results of science.

Unfortunately, the conclusions are not so clear cut. While it's easy to say

> We don't need people who can apply calculus. We need people who can **invent** calculus.

It's much harder to justify the scientific analog, something like "We don't need people who know how precipitation works. We need people who can *figure out* how precipitation works." This statement is false. Schools should teach students how the world works.

People are inherently curious. We want to know why the rain happens, where thunder comes from, and what the other planets look like. After a long hard battle against the unknown, wielding the tools of science, we know the answers to these questions. We should teach them to our students.

That said, it is *much more important* that our students learn the <span class="info" markdown="inline">methods of science</span>. It is nice for our students to know the names of the elements. However, it's far more important that they learn how to query reality. And it's *absolutely essential* that they learn how to listen to reality's response.

<aside class="info" markdown="block">
We would do well to teach not only the scientific method but @post[the method that supersedes it]science/beyond.
</aside>

That's the true message of science. That's the philosophy that shook the world.

> If you want to know how reality works, you have to listen to reality.

You can't draw a map of a city by sitting in your room with the blinds closed and thinking really hard about it. [In order to draw a map, you have to go outside and look at the territory](http://lesswrong.com/lw/gv/outside_the_laboratory/). This is perhaps the most important lesson of all.

You don't get to decide what is true. Reality gets to decide that. It's up to you to listen so that you can believe what is true.

This skill is far more difficult than it sounds, and it's the skill that we completely miss when we teach students things like precipitation and convection. We teach them to memorize the results of science, but the results aren't the important part.

I'm not suggesting that we stop teaching the results of science. The results of science are interesting, and it's important that everyone has a good feel for how the universe works. We don't need everyone to be a chemist, but everyone should know about molecules. We don't need everyone to be a biologist, but everyone should know about DNA.

*That said*, the results aren't the important part. In this respect science is like math: the part that we really want to teach must be taught indirectly.

If you want to teach science start by teaching rationality. Don't just tell them about mental biases, make them *experience* mental biases. Demonstrate the @post[hindsight bias]bias/hindsight in person. Don't warn them about [fake explanations](http://lesswrong.com/lw/gv/outside_the_laboratory/), show them directly how seductive the trap is.

Only once they're fully skeptical of their intuitions are they ready to begin.

Then, they're going to have to do experiments.

If you want a student to be able to recite the rules of physics then by all means lecture them in physics. But if you want them to *learn* physics they're going to have to figure it out themselves.

In order to teach students the results of science, have them do science. Don't tell them the answers and make them take notes. Make them discover the answers for themselves. Give them mysteries and ask them to explain.

The role of the teacher should be to nudge the student in the right direction. We needn't @post[drag them through the historical mire]science/mire. If a student starts down the wrong path, a teacher can point them towards an experiment that falsifies their budding theory. If a student gets stuck, a teacher can point them towards an experiment that will yield a surprising insight.

Reality was not nearly so kind to humanity. We've been side tracked for decades or centuries at a time. A smart teacher directing the experiments can help the students skip all that. With the right pointed questions students should be able to hit all the high points in a few short years.

Misconceptions could be squashed before they took root. Students wouldn't just know the theories, they'd know why all the alternatives failed. They'd have tried the obvious solutions and seen the fall flat.

They wouldn't be subjected to misinformation fueled by misinterpretation: they'd know exactly what the theory said and what it didn't say, because they discovered it on their own. They wouldn't misinterpret the @post[malleable words]language/scope, because they'd've seen @post[the thing that the words describe]reality/symbology.

Most importantly, they'd learn to ask reality for answers. Instead of listening to lectures, they'd have to design experiments. Instead of taking notes, they'd watch while their broken intuitions were torn asunder. In order to actually understand the phenomena they explored, they'd have no choice but to listen to actual reality.

When their experiments succeeded, they'd experience the elation of discovery which is so absent from science classrooms. And when their experiments failed, they'd have no choice but to discard their pet theories, to let go of their false beliefs.

This skill, more than any other, is the most important thing that a science education can teach.
