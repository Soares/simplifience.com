@post[Science isn't strong enough]science/failings. It's a brilliant idea that was good enough to sustain civilization for centuries, but it's not fast enough. It only asks you to discard wrong theories, it does not help you pluck right ones from the unknown. [If we are to survive](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risks_to_civilization,_humans,_and_planet_Earth#Artificial_intelligence) [the future](http://intelligence.org/files/IE-EI.pdf), we're going to need something better.

Fortunately science, like many scientific theories, has been superseded by something stronger.

Science asks us to listen to evidence when it shouts at us, falsifying our theories. If we are to do better, we must learn to listen to the evidence even when it whispers. Science can only distinguish between theories that are false and theories that are not yet false. If we are to step beyond science, we must assess the *degree of likilihood* of a theory, good or bad.

Fortunately for humanity, such a method has been invented. Unfortunately, it's been invented piecemeal throughout the past few centuries and across many disciplines.

If you want to do better than science you have to be able to assess the likelihood of a theory. You have to know how to update that likelihood when new evidence comes in. A method for such manipulations has been well developed in the realm of probability theory.

If you hope to uncover the true nature of reality, your likelihood had best take into account how much irrefutable baggage a theory comes with. You must be able to <span class="info" markdown="inline">strip a theory down</span> to its leanest bones and believe *only that* -- for if you do not, you subject yourself to human bias implicit in every authored theory. If you cannot pare down your theories, you will find yourself believing in the tiny gravity-angels that drive the earth around the sun in exact accordance to Einstein's laws.

<aside class="info" markdown="block">
Stripping a theory to the bare minimum is a generalization of the popular [Occam's razor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam's_razor).
</aside>

A method of paring down theories has been well explored in the realm of information theory.

We already know how to do better in science: we take the intersection of [Bayesian probability theory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_probability) and [Information theory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_theory).

These techniques are not new. These ideas are well-known. Information theory is a formalization of Occam's razor. Proofs of the [optimality of the Bayesian method](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimal_design#Model_uncertainty_and_Bayesian_approaches) are well known.

Unfortunately, the method of applying these theories in tandem does not have a short, catchy name. These tools were invented and vetted with caution and precision. There was no inquisition to overturn and no mysterious authority to buck. In the modern age there are many intellectuals, and change is difficult. Nobody sounded the horns when science was eclipsed: the new method crept up slowly and took over, and it <span class="info" markdown="inline">hasn't yet been given a name</span>.

<aside class="info" markdown="block">
There are some who call the movement "[Bayesianism](http://lesswrong.com/lw/1to/what_is_bayesianism/)". Simplifience avoids this term in part because it neglects the import of information theory, but mostly because it's derived from @post[the name of a dead man]intro/names.
</aside>

Henceforth, this post-scientific method shall be knows as <span class="define" markdown="inline">ratience</span>. Science led us out of our confusion and into the enlightenment. Ratience is the next step. Ratience is like science, except the theories are weighted by their informational content and then believed according to their probability.

<aside class="define" markdown="block">
__Ratience__ *n.*
A method for discovering true things. Ratience is a successor to science which incorporates information theory and probability theory.
</aside>

Science was good. It still is -- but we can do better. Like many scientific theories, science has been eclipsed by a stronger theory. Ratience encompasses science and then steps beyond. Science, like the classical world view of physics, must be consigned to the annals of history.

Science has our fondest memories, but it is the past. Ratience is the future.
