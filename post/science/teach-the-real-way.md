  Classical mechancis is taught before relativity and quantum mechanics. "Biology is too hard", everyone insists. "We can't tell people that the World Tree is actually the leg of an elephant until they've mastered tree-theory."

False. The hard part is *learning to be formal*. Relativity & QM are probably no harder to learn if you start from a blank slate. Even if there's an advantage (b/c hardware runs in the narrow human zone) we should teach things the way they *really are*. Otherwise we're cementing confusions, which makes it even harder to learn the true nature
