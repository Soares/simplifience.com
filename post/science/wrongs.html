Science is thrice wrong.

It's not wrong as in incorrect. Science is trustworthy, but it is still thrice wrong.

The first wrong is not with science itself, but with the way science is taught. Students are dragged through the @post[historical mire]science/mire, made to suffer the @post[same confusion]science/wrong-first that our forebearers faced. Humanity discovered the laws of the universe like seven blind monks discovering an elephant. We found the legs and thought they were tree trunks, then we found the tail and thought it a paintbrush, then we found the trunk and thought it a fire hose. We needn't drag students through the confusion of the past.

The second wrong is not with the scientific method, but with how we name things that the scientific method has forged. Half the discoveries of science were [named before they were understood](http://xkcd.com/567/). The other half are named for the @post[people who discovered them]intro/names. These shoddy names tie science tightly to its history and place an unnecessary burden of memorization upon students of the sciences.

The third wrong *is* a problem within science itself. Science is naught but a @post[method of thinking]science/method. That method is better than what came before, but it is @post[not strong enough]science/failings. Like many of the models that science has produced, science itself is correct but not complete.

For these reasons, simplifience must be both more and less than science.

Simplifience is less than science because it refuses to teach you the wrongs before it teaches you the rights.

Simplifience is more than science because it @post[goes beyond]science/beyond.
