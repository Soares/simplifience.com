title: Discarding Mathematics
name_in: {Foundations: The First Confusion}

There is a major confusion embedded in your mind. There's a term you know that is too meaningful.

That term is "Mathematics". Simplifience discards mathematics.

If you ask the average layperson what they think of mathematics, their reaction will likely range from pure hatred to mild distaste. When these people hear the term "mathematics", they think of theorems and proofs that they were forced to memorize. They think of the strange and @post[archaic]math/archaic symbols used to express @post[obvious-in-retrospect]reality/obvious ideas.

If you ask someone who has studied engineering or the sciences what they think of mathematics, they will tell you that math is not something which can be loved or hated -- math is simply the rules underlying any ordered system. It is any pattern, any abstraction. You can no more hate math than you can hate the fact that @post[reality is ordered]reality/unordered. Sure, the *language* of math is a bit old, but @post[symbols are not symbology]reality/symbology. Math is not the language, it's all that the language says.

If you ask a mathematician what they think of mathematics, they will answer that math is the @post[exploration]math/explore of any system of rules. Given any axioms, math is about plumbing the logical depths. It's about listening to what the rules say, and discovering new true things. It requires incredible creativity and modesty and the rewards are boundless, but it's not for everyone.

These are three wildly different definitions for "mathematics". So what *is* mathematics, really?

Is it $\Sigma$ and $+$ and $\frac{1}{4}$ and the other cumbersome notation?

Or is it the underlying rules of any system, regardless of the notation used?

Or is it instead the exploration of those sets of rules, the pursuit of truth?

Mathematics is *all of these things*. It is a word that <span class="info" markdown="inline">means too much</span>.

Henceforth, Simplifience proper will not use the term "Mathematics". Instead, we will refer to its components individually.

The *underlying rules of any system* will be referred to simply as "@post[the rules]intro/the-rules".

The *language and notation* used to describe such rules will be referred to as "@post[formal notation]intro/formal-notation" or sometimes just "formalization". We will be rigorous, formal, and well-defined, but we will not be beholden to history.

The exploration of the rules, the pursuit of truth, is @post[not a part]math/explore of simplifience. Exploration of the rules is among the noblest of pursuits. It leads to deep and unexpected truths which greatly expand our knowledge of the universe. It is the realm of those who wish to step beyond simplifience and <span class="info" markdown="inline">discover new rules</span>.

<aside class="info" markdown="block">
Simplifience covers the rules we've already discovered. With luck simplifience will leave you inquisitive about what truths lie beyond, in the unplumbed depths.
</aside>

The confusion of "Mathematics" is easily dealt with: we simply shatter the word into its component parts. Now we are free to describe the same *underlying rules* with a better *formal notation*, disregarding the exploratory overtones of standard @post[mathematics education]math/education.md.

We now leave the shattered word behind and step to the second confusion that permeates our formalisms, our language, and our culture. The second confusion will not fall quite so easily.
