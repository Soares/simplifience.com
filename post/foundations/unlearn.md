Simplifience is a @post[simpler way to look at reality]intro/motivation. In the normal course of simplifience articles the mainstream representation of math and science is @post[ignored]intro/decontriving until you've built up a solid intuition. You get to avoid the mainstream confusion entirely.

Unfortunately, there are a couple of mainstream confusions that are too large for me to dance around, too broad for me to avoid while I build up your intuition.

These confusions go straight to the core of our culture. They're embedded in the language. They've already infected your mind, and there's no way I can avoid them.

Since I can't avoid them, I'll have to root them out completely before we begin. We have to confront them directly.
