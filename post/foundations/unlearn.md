Simplifience is a @post[simpler way to look at reality]intro/motivation. In the normal course of simplifience articles, when we come across a concept that has a confusing representation in mainstream science I will ignore the mainstream entirely until I've built up a solid foundation of intuition. When I introduce the concept, you get to skip the mainstream confusion.

If I do my job right, you don't even notice what I've done until I point it out. Then, suddenly, everything clicks.

Unfortunately, there are a couple of mainstream confusions that are too large for me to dance around, too broad for me to avoid while I build up your intuition.

These confusions go straight to the core of our culture. They're embedded in the language. They've already infected your mind, and there's no way I can avoid them.

The first order of business is confronting these confusions <span class="info" markdown="inline">head on</span>.

Normally we'll be more subtle. In this case, confrontation is unavoidable. Brace yourself.
