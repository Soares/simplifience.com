Math and Science are wrong.

Oh, they're not wrong as in incorrect (though they have drawn incorrect conclusions before). They're wrong because they're *taught* wrong.

It's not their fault. Math is more than 2,500 years old. It's bound to pick up some historical <span class="define">cruft</span> along the way.

<aside class="define" markdown="block">
**cruft** _n._
Unnecessary complexities, unwanted excess. Poor design.
</aside>

Why come there is never enough things in the I don't know what I'm doing?

See, discoveries in science and mathematics are named long before they're understood. It's as if scientists and mathematicians found a broad tree trunk one day and named it "The Trunk". Centuries later, they discovered that they had been feeling up an elephant the whole time.

Now the elephant is wandering around and we still refer to each individual leg as "The Trunk" (even though there's more than one of them). To make matters worse, laymen think that "The Trunk" refers to the elephant's *trunk* and not an ignorant assessment of each individual *leg*, and <span class="info">nobody can be convinced</span> that the name is confusing and wrong.

<aside class="info">
That's how it's always been, you see. If it was good enough for Aristotle, why isn't it good enough for you?
</aside>

<span class="info">That will not happen here</span>. Simplifience is about understanding the universe in its simplest form.  We'll be leaving behind the cruft of history, the crutches of the past, the mistakes of our forebearers.

<aside class="info">
Rather, I will do my best to avoid it. I am only human, of course.
</aside>

In fact, I'm not even going to *<span class="rant">mention</span>* the true mistakes here. If you haven't heard them already, I don't want to confuse you first before showing you a better way. Because that's precisely the problem with science education today.

<aside class="rant" markdown="block">
I might mention them in the commentary. Red boxes are for mistakes. But even here I won't *explain* them.
</aside>

See, scientists are usually confused for a long time between making new discoveries and figuring out what's actually going on. And when we teach science, we drag people through that confusion. We say

> Then, Famous Scientist #1 did experiment A, and look how crazy the result was!
> So then Famous Scientist #2 did experiment B, and look! That's crazy too!
> Nobody understood it!

We do this for *decades* worth of experimentation before showing students how the experiments were based upon incorrect premises and that there's a <span class="simplifience">simple</span> explanation that accounts for all the madness.

<aside class="simplifience">
Simple, but perhaps mind-bending.

We say things like

> My students aren't advanced enough to understand relativity yet,
> because they don't understand all of the context --

So we go on teaching *wrong, old* science to all but the best and brightest.

I'm *not* going to drag you through that mud. I'm going to tell you what
we've discovered, I'm going to show you how the universe works. I'm *not* going
to do it one experiment at a time: I'm going to tell you the conclusions.

Every so often I'll link in a description of an <span class="knowledge">experiment</span> that backs my claims.  However, my goal here is not to convince you of how the world works. My goal here is to tell you how the world works: there are [plenty of resources](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/) on the internet to help you learn the rigorous proofs. I plan to give you the context and the setting by which to understand them.

<aside class="knowledge" markdown="block">
In a little box that looks like this. This color is for knowledge boxes.
</aside>

In sum, my goal is thus:

- <span class="simplifience">Tell you what we, the human species, have learned about this strange and beautiful universe in which we live.</span> We have uncovered much of the incredible nature of the universe, but most of our discoveries are hidden behind rigorous proofs in archaic languages.  This is a resource to teach you what we've learned of the universe @post[without]rigor requiring you to understand rigorously how we learned it.

<hr class="mark" />

- <span class="simplifience">Tell it to you on simple, unforgiving terms.</span> I won't make concessions to history or poor decisions. I will give things names that make sense in the context that I use them, not names based upon old dead scientists. The names and the terms that I use will <span class="rant">not be compatible</span> with mainstream science and mathematics, but they will be easier to understand.

<aside class="rant">
Don't fret, I'll point out places where I'm incompatible. And then promptly ignore them.
