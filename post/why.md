title: Why?
---
There's a big difference between a proof and a why.

Sometimes, I'll ask someone why something happens, and they'll show me a proof. We all know that $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$. But when I ask why this should be so, people show me proofs.

Proofs look like this:

This is fine. In fact, it's wonderful. Due to proofs such as these, I am absolutely convinced that $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$. @post[We have proven it, and so it must be true]sample/identity.

But the proof does not tell me *why*.

A why is more than a proof. A proof shows you that a thing must be true, but does not sate your curiosity. A why is an explanation. Where a proof forces you to believe, a why shows you that it can't be any other way.

A why tracks down flaws in your reasoning and fixes those, until the answer becomes self-evident. A why renders a proof unnecessary. Once you hold a why, the answer becomes obvious.

If you hold only a proof, you must guard it. It is a sacred mystery, a rule you must follow to understand the world. But once you attain a why, the proof is disposable. The holder of a why can <span class="rules" markdown="inline">create a proof with ease</span>.

More formally, proof derivation is [NP-hard](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NP-hard) but proof verification is [easy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_complexity#Polynomial_time). There is a wide gap between verifying a proof and creating it. A 'why' is knowledge which allows you to easily generate a particular proof.

If you want to come to reality on @post[its own terms]reality/terms, you're going to need more than just proofs. You're going to need to ask why.
