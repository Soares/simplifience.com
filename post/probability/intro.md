title: What is probability?

What is the probability that it will rain in Spain tomorrow? To make things more specific, what are the chances that it will rain in Madrid?

Seriously, try answering the question.

The question can't be answered. You don't have enough information to answer the question.

For the average student sitting in America, the best guess might be around 20%. If I tell you that it rained today, you might increase your probability to 70%. If I tell you that a thunderstorm is brewing, you may give it 95%. And, of course, a weather forecaster in Madrid will give you a closer answer.

So what's the "true" probability of rain in Madrid tomorrow?

*There's no such thing.*

It will either rain or it won't. Reality will pick a side. There is no probability in reality: *the probability is in you.*

Probability is a measure of your own state of knowledge. It's a measure of the things which you do not know. It is not something in the environment. There is no "true" probability of rain in Spain tomorrow. Rather, there are different probabilities given different states of knowledge.

When you flip a coin, reality does not magically select a face. The result depends upon how you were holding the coin, the way you flicked it, the air currents as it flies, the way it bounces when it lands. With sufficient knowledge and computational power, you could figure out how the coin will land before it's tossed. Reality does not play dice.

The fact that you assign 50% probability to the coin landing tails is not a fact of reality: the coin will land heads or tails, not some <span class="main">weird half-mix of both</span>.

Disregarding edge cases, of course.

The 50% probability is not an aspect of the coin. Assigning heads a 50% probability is an aspect of *you*. It is a statement of your lack of knowledge. It is an admonition that you do not poses the knowledge or the power required to figure out the result of the toss before the coin lands. It is a statement of belief, that you don't think the unknowns in the environment favor one side over the other.

Probability is a statement of your own knowledge, or lack thereof. The coin itself will land either heads or tails. Reality does not have probabilities, it has events.

The probability is not in the coin. It is in you.
