During recessions, people spend a larger portion of their income than in prosperous times.

Seems obvious, right? During a recession, you can't save as much. Salaries stagnate while prices rise. Even if people cut down on spending, they end up spending a greater portion of their income just to stay afloat. Unemployment raises, and the unemployed have to dig into their savings -- if they have any.

Like the results of all psychology experiments, the results of this experiment were obvious. It's not entirely clear why psychologists wasted money to perform the study, when the answer could have easily been predicted in advance.

Most people think they would have predicted this result -- until they learn that I was lying.

Actually, people spend a larger portion of their income in prosperous times.

Which makes sense, now that you know it. This is a consumerist culture. When times are good, we buy houses and put down money on cars and indulge in excess. We try to keep up with the Joneses. We don't have the forethought to worry about savings, except when times are tough.

It should be obvious, now that you know.

Except that I'm lying to you again.

Or am I?

You don't know. Do people spend a greater portion of their income during a recession? I'm not going to tell you. You aren't sure. *The answer is no longer obvious.*

It was so obvious when you knew it, but I have stripped that knowledge from you. Now that you really actually don't know, I want you to make a prediction.

Yes or no? With what probability?

Contrast this answer with your answer above. Notice the difference between this feeling and the feeling you had before. Do people actually spend a larger portion of their income in recessions, or don't they? You're not sure. In order to find out you have to actually check. You have to actually @post[ask reality]science/method.

When you know, it's easy to feel like you knew it all along. [*You didn't know it all along*](http://csml.som.ohio-state.edu/Music829C/hindsight.bias.html). [Knowing the result alters what you think would have been obvious](http://lesswrong.com/lw/il/hindsight_bias/).

Humans have a strong tendency to believe that the results are obvious *after they know them*. This is called hindsight bias, and [it's dangerous](http://lesswrong.com/lw/im/hindsight_devalues_science/). It's one of the reasons why those meditation boxes are important: they help you see the distinction.

You no longer know whether people a larger or smaller share of their income during recessions. You've just felt a tiny unknown. Perhaps it doesn't disturb you very much: if you're still curious when you finish this article you can Google the answer. But before you do that, I want you to inspect your bewilderment.

Imagine you can't Google it. Imagine that the question has never been investigated. Imagine that the only way to find out is to perform the study. That's what it feels like to poses an easy question. The answer is not obvious, but you know where to find it.

Now imagine holding a hard question. Imagine holding a question where nobody even knowns what the answer will look like or where it will be. Imagine not even knowing if your @post[question is connected to reality]reality/connected.

Imagine standing on the brink of human knowledge, staring out where nobody has gone before. Imagine trying to make sense of the chaos, without Google by your side.

If you ever manage to find an answer in that darkness, everyone will say it was obvious. But *everything* seem obvious to humans. Human brains can justify anything in hindsight. When you're standing out there facing the unknown, there are a thousand paths before you, and each leads to a conclusion that everyone will say was obvious. Which path do you choose?

In retrospect, it feels obvious that the Earth follows the same laws as the Heavens. It feels obvious that the earth is round. Inventing bows and arrows is an obvious way to hunt.

__These discoveries are only obvious in hindsight.__ They're not obvious when you're out there in the fray trying to discover them.

All of human human progress hangs on obvious discoveries. A thousand years of stagnant silence can be shattered by a single idea, which seems oh so obvious in retrospect.

Never underestimate the difficulty of having obvious ideas.
