During recessions, people spend a larger portion of their income than in prosperous times.

Seems obvious, right? During a recession, you can't save as much. Salaries stagnate while prices rise. Even if people cut down on spending, they end up spending a greater portion of their income.

Like the results of all psychology experiments, the results of this experiment were obvious. It's not entirely clear why psychologists spent the money during the study, when the answer could have easily been predicted in advance.

Most people think they would have predicted this result -- until they learn that I was lying.

Actually, people spend a larger portion of their income in prosperous times.

Which makes sense, now that you know it. This is a consumerist culture. When times are good, we buy houses and put down money on cars and indulge in excess. We try to keep up with the Joneses. We don't have the forethought to worry about savings, except when times are tough.

It's obvious, now that you know.

Except that I'm lying to you again.

Or am I?

You don't know any more. You aren't sure. *The answer is no longer obvious*.

The answer was so obvious when you knew it, but now I have stripped that knowledge from you. Now that you really actually don't know, I want you to make a prediction.

Yes or no? With what probability?

Notice the difference between this feeling and the feeling you had before. Do people actually spend a larger portion of their income in recessions, or don't they? You're not sure. In order to find out you have to actually check. You have to actually ask reality.

[You didn't know it all along](http://csml.som.ohio-state.edu/Music829C/hindsight.bias.html).

[Knowing the result alters what you think would have been obvious](http://lesswrong.com/lw/il/hindsight_bias/).

Humans have a strong tendency to believe that the results are obvious *after they know them*. This is called @post[hindsight bias]bias/hindsight, and it's dangerous. It's one of the reasons that Simplifience has those little meditation boxes.

And this is nothing compared to a true Unknown. When you leave this article still curious, you can Google the answer. But before you do, hold on to that feeling. Inspect it.

Imagine that nobody on earth knows the answer. The only way to find it is to go check the real world. That's what it feels like to poses an easy question: A question whose answer is not obvious, but that you know how to figure out.

Now imagine holding a hard unknown.

Imagine standing on the brink of human knowledge, staring out where nobody has gone before. Imagine trying to make sense of the chaos, without Google by your side.

When you find the answer, everyone will say it was obvious. But until you find it, you don't even know which of a hundred obvious answers you should try first. The way forward is simple: but when you don't know which way is the right way, you're faced with a thousand thousand possibilities, each appearing just as simple as the next. Which one do you choose?

In retrospect, it feels obvious that the Earth follows the same laws as the Heavens. It feels obvious that the earth is flat. Inventing bows and arrows is an obvious way to hunt.

__None of those things are obvious.__ Not when you're there, before the discoveries were made.

All of human history hinged upon those discoveries. All of human human progress hangs on simple ideas. A thousand years of stagnant silence can be shattered by a single idea, which seems oh so obvious in retrospect.

Never underestimate the difficulty of having obvious ideas.
