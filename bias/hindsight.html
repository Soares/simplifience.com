				<p>During recessions, people spend a larger portion of their income than in prosperous times.</p>

<p>Seems obvious, right? During a recession, you can&#8217;t save as much. Salaries stagnate while prices rise. Even if people cut down on spending, they end up spending a greater portion of their income just to stay afloat. Unemployment raises, and the unemployed have to dig into their savings &#8211; if they have any.</p>

<p>Like the results of all psychology experiments, the results of this experiment were obvious. It&#8217;s not entirely clear why psychologists wasted money to perform the study, when the answer could have easily been predicted in advance.</p>

<p>Most people think they would have predicted this result &#8211; until they learn that I was lying.</p>

<p>Actually, people spend a larger portion of their income in prosperous times.</p>

<p>Which makes sense, now that you know it. This is a consumerist culture. When times are good, we buy houses and put down money on cars and indulge in excess. We try to keep up with the Joneses. We don&#8217;t have the forethought to worry about savings, except when times are tough.</p>

<p>It should be obvious, now that you know.</p>

<p><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br /></p>

<p>Except that I&#8217;m lying to you again.</p>

<p><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br /></p>

<p>Or am I?</p>

<p>You don&#8217;t know. Do people spend a greater portion of their income during a recession? I&#8217;m not going to tell you. You aren&#8217;t sure. <em>The answer is no longer obvious.</em></p>

<p>It was so obvious when you knew it, but I have stripped that knowledge from you. Now that you really actually don&#8217;t know, I want you to make a prediction.</p>

<p>Contrast this answer with your answer above. Notice the difference between this feeling and the feeling you had before. Do people actually spend a larger portion of their income in recessions, or don&#8217;t they? You&#8217;re not sure. In order to find out you have to actually check. You have to actually <a href="/science/method.html">ask reality</a>.</p>

<p>When you know, it&#8217;s easy to feel like you knew it all along. <a href="http://csml.som.ohio-state.edu/Music829C/hindsight.bias.html"><em>You didn&#8217;t know it all along</em></a>. <a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/il/hindsight_bias/">Knowing the result alters what you think would have been obvious</a>.</p>

<p>Humans have a strong tendency to believe that the results are obvious <em>after they know them</em>. This is called hindsight bias, and <a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/im/hindsight_devalues_science/">it&#8217;s dangerous</a>. It&#8217;s one of the reasons why the little meditations are important: they keep the line distinct.</p>

<p>You no longer know whether people a larger or smaller share of their income during recessions. You&#8217;ve just felt a tiny unknown. Perhaps it doesn&#8217;t disturb you very much: if you&#8217;re still curious when you finish this article you can Google the answer. But before you do that, I want you to inspect your bewilderment.</p>

<p>Imagine you can&#8217;t Google it. Imagine that the question has never been investigated. Imagine that the only way to find out is to perform the study. That&#8217;s what it feels like to poses an easy question. The answer is not obvious, but you know where to find it.</p>

<p>Now imagine holding a hard question. Imagine holding a question where nobody even knowns what the answer will look like or where it will be. Imagine not even knowing if your <a href="/reality/connected.html">question is connected to reality</a>.</p>

<p>Imagine standing on the brink of human knowledge, staring out where nobody has gone before. Imagine trying to make sense of the chaos, without Google by your side.</p>

<p>If you ever manage to find an answer in that darkness, everyone will say it was obvious. But <em>everything</em> seem obvious to humans. Human brains can justify anything in hindsight. When you&#8217;re standing out there facing the unknown, there are a thousand paths before you, and each leads to a conclusion that everyone will say was obvious. Which path do you choose?</p>

<p>In retrospect, it feels obvious that the Earth follows the same laws as the Heavens. It feels obvious that the earth is round. Inventing bows and arrows is an obvious way to hunt.</p>

<p><strong>These discoveries are only obvious in hindsight.</strong> They&#8217;re not obvious when you&#8217;re out there in the fray trying to discover them.</p>

<p>All of human human progress hangs on obvious discoveries. A thousand years of stagnant silence can be shattered by a single idea, which seems oh so obvious in retrospect.</p>

<p>Never underestimate the difficulty of having obvious ideas.</p>
