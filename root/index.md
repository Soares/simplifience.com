title: Simplifience

Behold the deepest question ever asked: *@link[Why?]why*

Why is the sky blue? Why does the world spin? Why are we here? *Why?*

This question has been asked since the dawn of thought, and it will haunt us until the end of time.

Humankind has made incredible progress towards answering the ultimate whys. We know more about the nature of existence now than ever before. And yet, that knowledge is not readily taught.

<span class="knowledge">Science</span> is tightly coupled with its history. Teachers needlessly drag students through the confusion that our forebearers faced.

<span class="rules">Mathematics</span> is replaced by rote memorization, hiding the
deep understanding that only mathematics can provide.

<span class="simplifience">Simplifience</span> is neither math nor science. It is both more and less. It is a quest to understand the universe.
