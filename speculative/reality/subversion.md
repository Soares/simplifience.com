title: Subversion of Verities
---

Humankind has discovered many of the underlying @post[verities]reality/verities of nature.

Or, at least, we think we have.

The thing is, we've been wrong before.

Many a time, we've thought we possessed a rule of the universe only to watch it disappear before our eyes.

It's not that our equations turned out to be wrong. We didn't abandon absolute physics because we found a regular old game of pool that decided to ignore absolute physics. Physics didn't switch the rules. No, we abandoned absolute physics because we found crazy, far-out edge cases that violated the @post[axioms]reality/axioms.

Absolute physics is still true, *given* the axioms. It just turns out that reality doesn't obey those axioms.

All the proofs of flat geometry is true, @post[given the axioms]math/explore. The universe looks like a place where flat geometry applies.

Sometimes, reality surprises us.
