				<p>Math is like cheat codes.</p>

<p style="font-size: 3em; text-align: center">&uarr; &uarr; &darr; &darr; &larr; &rarr; &larr; &rarr; B A</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not here to garner appreciation for mathematics. I&#8217;m not implying that math allows you to hack reality and make your life better. Quite the opposite: Math is like cheat codes <em>for a game you aren&#8217;t playing</em>.</p>

<p>Sure, sometimes you&#8217;re playing the right game and you know the right codes. Then math is great. But most of the time, nobody&#8217;s playing the game.</p>

<p>Math education is forcing students to memorize the cheat codes for a game that they don&#8217;t care about. Students &#8211; often smarter than we give them credit for &#8211; are aware that these boring equations are useless to them. But whenever they ask for purpose, teachers respond</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Well, you might play this particular game one day. When you do, it&#8217;s important to know the cheat codes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is wrong in so many ways it&#8217;s going to be difficult to enumerate them in a single narrative.</p>

<p>For starters, the knee-jerk response to this drivel is &#8220;well then I&#8217;ll never play your stupid game&#8221; &#8211; and that&#8217;s exactly what four out of five students do. They avoid science, engineering, math, and technology because they were forced to learn the boring cheat codes for those games, and they sounded repetitive, so the games must be dull.</p>

<p>This is a rational response to the <span class="info">atrocious education</span> that we provide.</p>

<aside class="info">
  <p>Suggestions come later.</p>
</aside>

<p>But the problem is worse than that. Imagine a situation where our math education works perfectly. Imagine a student who has memorized all of the right cheat codes and who&#8217;s stumbled into exactly the right game. When this happens, we measure success by how quickly the student cheats their way through the game without ever actually playing.</p>

<p>The ability to memorize and apply formulas is not mathematics! It allows you to solve math problems in limited, specific scenarios where you recognizes that your memorized formula can be used, but being able to do calculus doesn&#8217;t make you Newton.</p>

<p>A student hasn&#8217;t learned calculus when they can derive an equation. A student has learned calculus when I can walk into the school and erase calculus from their mind completely and <em>then they rebuild it</em>.</p>

<p>The big insight of mathematics is that certain types of problem show up everywhere &#8211; biology, statistics, music, economics &#8211; and if you can solve the problem one then you can use the same method to solve it anywhere. It doesn&#8217;t matter what method you use. It doesn&#8217;t matter what syntax or terminology you use. What matters is looking at a problem and saying &#8220;I&#8217;ve solved something like this elsewhere, can I use the same techniques here?&#8221;</p>

<p>If you learn economics and then try to learn biology, it&#8217;s easier because lots of problems are the same. It doesn&#8217;t matter if you&#8217;re asking how money grows or if you&#8217;re asking how populations grow, understanding one makes it easier to understand the other.</p>

<p>And yet we teach students calculus <em>first</em>. We tell them to <span class="info">memorize these abstract formulas</span> that they don&#8217;t understand the need for and <em>then</em> we show them biology problems and say &#8220;just apply that formula you memorized&#8221;. Sure, it&#8217;s easier: they apply a stored formula and the &#8220;right answer&#8221; (as determined by how the teacher grades it) comes out. But they don&#8217;t understand <em>why</em>. If I erase the equations from their brain then they can&#8217;t solve the problems any more.</p>

<aside class="info">
  <p>Because physics is way easier to cheat through if you&#8217;ve memorized calculus.</p>
</aside>

<p>The way we <em>should</em> teach calculus is by teaching biology and chemistry and physics and economics and throwing the same problem at students in each of their classes. Make them struggle with the same problem in ten guises until they start to see the pattern.</p>

<p>Solving it once will be hard. The second time will be easier. Once they&#8217;ve solved the problem thrice, they&#8217;ll be able to apply their techniques and solve it anywhere. <em>Now</em> they&#8217;re starting to learn calculus.</p>

<p>Throw the problem at them in ten new contexts to test their resolve. Once they start breezing through, throw it at them ten more ways. By the time they&#8217;re done they&#8217;ll know their technique so well that they can write it down. Take a look at what they wrote down. <em>That&#8217;s</em> calculus. It&#8217;s <em>their</em> calculus. If I erase the equations from their mind they&#8217;ll be able to reconstruct it with ease: because it&#8217;s an encoding of their own problem solving method.</p>

<p>Once you know calculus, the equations don&#8217;t matter. You don&#8217;t know mathematics until you can reconstruct the equations on your own.</p>

<p>Math is just a collection of techniques. It&#8217;s cheat codes for solving problems that show up all over the place. If you show students the cheat codes <em>first</em>, before they see the problems, then the codes are boring. It&#8217;s like teaching students music by forcing them to <span class="info">memorize the sheet</span> musing for Beethoven&#8217;s $5^{th}$.</p>

<aside class="info">
  <p>You can learn a lot about fugues and music from Beethoven&#8217;s $5^{th}$, but forcing students to memorize the sheet music is a <em>horrible</em> way to teach.</p>
</aside>

<p>Make them play the game first. Make them live through the repetition until they make up their own codes. When the students see the patterns they&#8217;ll <span class="info">exploit them on their own</span>. Then their techniques won&#8217;t be cheat codes: they&#8217;ll be shortcuts.</p>

<aside class="info">
  <p>It&#8217;s human nature. When faced with a repetitive task you&#8217;ll develop a technique to manage it. Problem-solving techniques are called &#8216;math&#8217;.</p>
</aside>

<p>It used to be good enough for students to memorize and apply the techniques handed down by the ancients. It used to be acceptable to memorize a bunch of derivative laws instead of really <em>knowing</em> calculus. Such students could turn the cranks and solve calculus problems, which weren&#8217;t going to solve themselves.</p>

<p>Those days are behind us. Now we can teach computers to apply formulas. Calculus problems <em>can</em> solve themselves. One computer programmer isn&#8217;t worth ten number crankers, nor even one hundred: one computer programmer is worth <em>all</em> of the number crankers. We live in a world where programming a computer to solve a problem once allows computers can solve that problem a billion times per second, forever.</p>

<p>We don&#8217;t need people who can apply calculus any more. We need people who can <em>invent</em> calculus.</p>

<h2 id="what-can-we-do-about-it">What can we do about it?</h2>

<p>Math class is like <a href="/allegory/doors.html" target="_blank">door-opening</a> class. Opening doors is surely a life skill. Everyone should know how to open car doors and kitchen doors.</p>

<p>Some people need to know how to open space shuttle doors or military bunker doors, and some people will need to pick locks when they lock themselves out of the house. This doesn&#8217;t mean we should teach door-opening: instead, we should teach reasoning and dexterity. With reasoning and dexterity, people can get through all of the doors they&#8217;ll usually encounter. If they get a job with specialized doors, they&#8217;ll learn how to open them on the job.</p>

<p>Math is the same way. We shouldn&#8217;t have &#8220;math&#8221; classes. Math is just techniques for solving problems. Instead, we should teach students many other subjects. Teach them how big things work and how small things work. Teach them how populations act and how governments react. Teach them how muscles work and how molecules work and where the rain comes from. But don&#8217;t just make them memorize these things: make them predict. Give them problems to solve.</p>

<p>Do this, and math is whatever falls out of the process. Math is everything that they take from one class and use in another class.</p>

<p>This amount of math is enough for the average person. The ability to take techniques from one class and apply them to problems in another class is <em>far</em> more important than <span class="info">trigonometry</span>. The ability to look at a problem and develop your own methods of finding a solution, instead of memorizing the teacher&#8217;s solution, is an incredibly important skill.</p>

<aside class="info">
  <p>If you know these things, you can <em>invent</em> trigonometry. If you just memorize trigonometry then it&#8217;s next to useless.</p>
</aside>

<p>If we can teach these skills to students instead of pre-calculus, we will do them a great favor.</p>

<p>It is not important that our students know algebra &#8211; it is important that our students have the reasoning skills to <em>invent</em> algebra. We shouldn&#8217;t be satisfied when they memorize a particular algebraic syntax. We should be satisfied only when they&#8217;ve invented something akin to algebra for solving all the problems that we throw at them.</p>

<p>Once the students start to cross-pollinate, once they begin to take their tools from once class to the next, then we can teach them abstraction. Put them in a class where they&#8217;re told to solve a problem in the most general way they can, and then apply their solution to situations they didn&#8217;t anticipate. Give them questions and then change the background. Teach them to react. Teach them to develop methods for creating general solutions to general problems, and then it doesn&#8217;t matter what ancient math equations they know.</p>

<p>Mathematics should be taught indirectly.</p>

<p>We don&#8217;t need everyone to know calculus. We don&#8217;t need everyone to know trigonometry. We don&#8217;t need everyone to know <em>any</em> specific techniques. We need everyone to know that <em>there are techniques</em>. We need people to realize that math isn&#8217;t about solving problems: math is about <em>eliminating</em> problems. Math is about solving a problem so hard than next time you come across something that looks even remotely similar, it&#8217;s already solved.</p>

<p>What matters is understanding that problems have patterns to them. If you develop a method to solve one, you solve them all. Newton, Einstein, and Maxwell weren&#8217;t people who were especially good at remembering the product rule. They didn&#8217;t discover laws of the universe by being <em>really good</em> at memorizing trigonometry. They advanced human knowledge by inventing new ways to solve problems.</p>

<p>After students understand how to make their own techniques, once they prove that they can look at problems and find their own ways to solve them, <em>then</em> we can start <span class="info">giving them the cheat codes</span>. We can rush them through the problems that humanity has already solved in order to get their minds to the forefront of our understanding.</p>

<aside class="info">
  <p>At that point they may not want the cheat codes. Few feelings compare to discovering new truths. Some people won&#8217;t want spoilers.</p>
</aside>

<p>We should only do this once we&#8217;re convinced that they can invent mathematics on their own. That skill, <em>not the specific equations</em>, is the important part of math.</p>

<p>We have no shortage of equation solvers. What we need are people who can walk out to the very edge of human knowledge, stare into the wild unknown, and say</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I can invent ways to understand this.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Everyone else is just cranking numbers.</p>
